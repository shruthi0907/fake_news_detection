 Donald Trump Sends Out Embarrassing New Yearâ€™s Eve Message; This is Disturbing,"Donald Trump just couldn t wish all Americans a Happy New Year and leave it at that. Instead, he had to give a shout out to his enemies, haters and  the very dishonest fake news media.  The former reality show star had just one job to do and he couldn t do it. As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter, I want to wish all of my friends, supporters, enemies, haters, and even the very dishonest Fake News Media, a Happy and Healthy New Year,  President Angry Pants tweeted.  2018 will be a great year for America!

 Drunk Bragging Trump Staffer Started Russian Collusion Investigation,"House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes is going to have a bad day. He s been under the assumption, like many of us, that the Christopher Steele-dossier was what prompted the Russia investigation so he s been lashing out at the Department of Justice and the FBI in order to protect Trump. As it happens, the dossier is not what started the investigation, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.Former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was drunk in a wine bar when he revealed knowledge of Russian opposition research on Hillary Clinton.On top of that, Papadopoulos wasn t just a covfefe boy for Trump, as his administration has alleged. He had a much larger role, but none so damning as being a drunken fool in a wine bar. Coffee boys  don t help to arrange a New York meeting between Trump and President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt two months before the election. It was known before that the former aide set up meetings with world leaders for Trump, but team Trump ran with him being merely a coffee boy.In May 2016, Papadopoulos revealed to Australian diplomat Alexander Downer that Russian officials were shopping around possible dirt on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Exactly how much Mr. Papadopoulos said that night at the Kensington Wine Rooms with the Australian, Alexander Downer, is unclear,  the report states.  But two months later, when leaked Democratic emails began appearing online, Australian officials passed the information about Mr. Papadopoulos to their American counterparts, according to four current and former American and foreign officials with direct knowledge of the Australians  role. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. and is now a cooperating witness with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This isn t a presidency. It s a badly scripted reality TV show.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.",News
 Sheriff David Clarke Becomes An Internet Joke For Threatening To Poke People â€˜In The Eyeâ€™,"On Friday, it was revealed that former Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke, who was being considered for Homeland Security Secretary in Donald Trump s administration, has an email scandal of his own.In January, there was a brief run-in on a plane between Clarke and fellow passenger Dan Black, who he later had detained by the police for no reason whatsoever, except that maybe his feelings were hurt. Clarke messaged the police to stop Black after he deplaned, and now, a search warrant has been executed by the FBI to see the exchanges.Clarke is calling it fake news even though copies of the search warrant are on the Internet. I am UNINTIMIDATED by lib media attempts to smear and discredit me with their FAKE NEWS reports designed to silence me,  the former sheriff tweeted.

 Trump Is So Obsessed He Even Has Obamaâ€™s Name Coded Into His Website (IMAGES),"On Christmas day, Donald Trump announced that he would  be back to work  the following day, but he is golfing for the fourth day in a row. The former reality show star blasted former President Barack Obama for playing golf and now Trump is on track to outpace the number of golf games his predecessor played.Updated my tracker of Trump s appearances at Trump properties.71 rounds of golf including today s. At this pace, he ll pass Obama s first-term total by July 24 next year. https://t.co/Fg7VacxRtJ pic.twitter.com/5gEMcjQTbH  Philip Bump (@pbump) December 29, 2017 That makes what a Washington Post reporter discovered on Trump s website really weird, but everything about this administration is bizarre AF. The coding contained a reference to Obama and golf:  Unlike Obama, we are working to fix the problem   and not on the golf course.  However, the coding wasn t done correctly.The website of Donald Trump, who has spent several days in a row at the golf course, is coded to serve up the following message in the event of an internal server error: https://t.co/zrWpyMXRcz pic.twitter.com/wiQSQNNzw0  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017That snippet of code appears to be on all https://t.co/dkhw0AlHB4 pages, which the footer says is paid for by the RNC? pic.twitter.com/oaZDT126B3  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017It s also all over https://t.co/ayBlGmk65Z. As others have noted in this thread, this is weird code and it s not clear it would ever actually display, but who knows.  Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 28, 2017After the coding was called out, the reference to Obama was deleted.UPDATE: The golf error message has been removed from the Trump and GOP websites. They also fixed the javascript  =  vs  ==  problem.

Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) December 29, 2017 The code was f-cked up.The best part about this is that they are using the  =  (assignment) operator which means that bit of code will never get run.

 Pope Francis Just Called Out Donald Trump During His Christmas Speech,"Pope Francis used his annual Christmas Day message to rebuke Donald Trump without even mentioning his name. The Pope delivered his message just days after members of the United Nations condemned Trump s move to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. The Pontiff prayed on Monday for the  peaceful coexistence of two states within mutually agreed and internationally recognized borders. We see Jesus in the children of the Middle East who continue to suffer because of growing tensions between Israelis and Palestinians,  Francis said.  On this festive day, let us ask the Lord for peace for Jerusalem and for all the Holy Land. Let us pray that the will to resume dialogue may prevail between the parties and that a negotiated solution can finally be reached. The Pope went on to plead for acceptance of refugees who have been forced from their homes, and that is an issue Trump continues to fight against. Francis used Jesus for which there was  no place in the inn  as an analogy. Today, as the winds of war are blowing in our world and an outdated model of development continues to produce human, societal and environmental decline, Christmas invites us to focus on the sign of the Child and to recognize him in the faces of little children, especially those for whom, like Jesus,  there is no place in the inn,  he said. Jesus knows well the pain of not being welcomed and how hard it is not to have a place to lay one s head,  he added.  May our hearts not be closed as they were in the homes of Bethlehem. The Pope said that Mary and Joseph were immigrants who struggled to find a safe place to stay in Bethlehem. They had to leave their people, their home, and their land,  Francis said.  This was no comfortable or easy journey for a young couple about to have a child.   At heart, they were full of hope and expectation because of the child about to be born; yet their steps were weighed down by the uncertainties and dangers that attend those who have to leave their home behind. So many other footsteps are hidden in the footsteps of Joseph and Mary,  Francis said Sunday. We see the tracks of entire families forced to set out in our own day. We see the tracks of millions of persons who do not choose to go away, but driven from their land, leave behind their dear ones. Amen to that.Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images.",News
 Racist Alabama Cops Brutalize Black Boy While He Is In Handcuffs (GRAPHIC IMAGES),"The number of cases of cops brutalizing and killing people of color seems to see no end. Now, we have another case that needs to be shared far and wide. An Alabama woman by the name of Angela Williams shared a graphic photo of her son, lying in a hospital bed with a beaten and fractured face, on Facebook. It needs to be shared far and wide, because this is unacceptable.It is unclear why Williams  son was in police custody or what sort of altercation resulted in his arrest, but when you see the photo you will realize that these details matter not. Cops are not supposed to beat and brutalize those in their custody. In the post you are about to see, Ms. Williams expresses her hope that the cops had their body cameras on while they were beating her son, but I think we all know that there will be some kind of convenient  malfunction  to explain away the lack of existence of dash or body camera footage of what was clearly a brutal beating. Hell, it could even be described as attempted murder. Something tells me that this young man will never be the same. Without further ado, here is what Troy, Alabama s finest decided was appropriate treatment of Angela Williams  son:No matter what the perceived crime of this young man might be, this is completely unacceptable. The cops who did this need to rot in jail for a long, long time   but what you wanna bet they get a paid vacation while the force  investigates  itself, only to have the officers returned to duty posthaste?This, folks, is why we say BLACK LIVES MATTER. No way in hell would this have happened if Angela Williams  son had been white. Please share far and wide, and stay tuned to Addicting Info for further updates.Featured image via David McNew/Stringer/Getty Images",News
" Fresh Off The Golf Course, Trump Lashes Out At FBI Deputy Director And James Comey","Donald Trump spent a good portion of his day at his golf club, marking the 84th day he s done so since taking the oath of office. It must have been a bad game because just after that, Trump lashed out at FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on Twitter following a report saying McCabe plans to retire in a few months. The report follows McCabe s testimony in front of congressional committees this week, as well as mounting criticism from Republicans regarding the Russia probe.So, naturally, Trump attacked McCabe with a lie. How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin  James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?  Trump tweeted.How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin  James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?

Trump has been fact-checked before on his claim of his wife receiving $700,000 for her campaign.Politifact noted in late July that Trump s  tweet about Andrew McCabe is a significant distortion of the facts. And the implication that McCabe got Clinton off as a political favor doesn t make much sense when we look at the evidence. His July tweet was rated  mostly false.  But Trump repeats these lies because he knows his supporters will believe them without bothering to Google. It s still a lie, though.Photo by Zach Gibson   Pool/Getty Images.",News
" Trump Said Some INSANELY Racist Stuff Inside The Oval Office, And Witnesses Back It Up","In the wake of yet another court decision that derailed Donald Trump s plan to bar Muslims from entering the United States, the New York Times published a report on Saturday morning detailing the president s frustration at not getting his way   and how far back that frustration goes.According to the article, back in June, Trump stomped into the Oval Office, furious about the state of the travel ban, which he thought would be implemented and fully in place by then. Instead, he fumed, visas had already been issued to immigrants at such a rate that his  friends were calling to say he looked like a fool  after making his broad pronouncements.It was then that Trump began reading from a document that a top advisor, noted white supremacist Stephen Miller, had handed him just before the meeting with his Cabinet. The page listed how many visas had been issued this year, and included 2,500 from Afghanistan (a country not on the travel ban), 15,000 from Haiti (also not included), and 40,000 from Nigeria (sensing a pattern yet?), and Trump expressed his dismay at each.According to witnesses in the room who spoke to the Times on condition of anonymity, and who were interviewed along with three dozen others for the article, Trump called out each country for its faults as he read: Afghanistan was a  terrorist haven,  the people of Nigeria would  never go back to their huts once they saw the glory of America, and immigrants from Haiti  all have AIDS. Despite the extensive research done by the newspaper, the White House of course denies that any such language was used.But given Trump s racist history and his advisor Stephen Miller s blatant white nationalism, it would be no surprise if a Freedom of Information Act request turned up that the document in question had the statements printed inline as commentary for the president to punctuate his anger with. It was Miller, after all, who was responsible for the  American Carnage  speech that Trump delivered at his inauguration.This racist is a menace to America, and he doesn t represent anything that this country stands for. Let s hope that more indictments from Robert Mueller are on their way as we speak.Featured image via Chris Kleponis/Pool/Getty Images",News
" Former CIA Director Slams Trump Over UN Bullying, Openly Suggests Heâ€™s Acting Like A Dictator (TWEET)","Many people have raised the alarm regarding the fact that Donald Trump is dangerously close to becoming an autocrat. The thing is, democracies become autocracies right under the people s noses, because they can often look like democracies in the beginning phases. This was explained by Republican David Frum just a couple of months into Donald Trump s presidency, in a piece in The Atlantic called  How to Build an Autocracy. In fact, if you really look critically at what is happening right now   the systematic discrediting of vital institutions such as the free press and the Federal Bureau of Investigation as well the direct weaponization of the Department of Justice in order to go after Trump s former political opponent, 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and you have the makings of an autocracy. We are more than well on our way. Further, one chamber of Congress, the House of Representatives, already has a rogue band of Republicans who are running a parallel investigation to the official Russian collusion investigation, with the explicit intent of undermining and discrediting the idea that Trump could have possibly done anything wrong with the Russians in order to swing the 2016 election in his favor.All of that is just for starters, too. Now, we have Trump making United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley bully and threaten other countries in the United Nations who voted against Trump s decision to change U.S. policy when it comes to recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of the Jewish State. Well, one expert, who is usually quite measured, has had enough of Trump s autocratic antics: Former CIA Director John O. Brennan. The seasoned spy took to Trump s favorite platform, Twitter, and blasted the decision:Trump Admin threat to retaliate against nations that exercise sovereign right in UN to oppose US position on Jerusalem is beyond outrageous. Shows @realDonaldTrump expects blind loyalty and subservience from everyone qualities usually found in narcissistic, vengeful autocrats.  John O. Brennan (@JohnBrennan) December 21, 2017Director Brennan is correct, of course. Trump is behaving just like an autocrat, and so many people in the nation are asleep when it comes to this dangerous age, in which the greatest threat to democracy and the very fabric of the republic itself is the American president. Fellow Americans, we know the GOP-led Congress will not be the check on Trump that they are supposed to be. It s time to get out and flip the House and possibly the Senate in 2018, and resist in the meantime, if we want to save our country from devolving into something that looks more like Russia or North Korea than the America we have always know. We re already well on our way.Featured image via BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images",News
 WATCH: Brand-New Pro-Trump Ad Features So Much A** Kissing It Will Make You Sick,"Just when you might have thought we d get a break from watching people kiss Donald Trump s ass and stroke his ego ad nauseam, a pro-Trump group creates an ad that s nothing but people doing even more of those exact things. America First Policies is set to release this ad, called  Thank You, President Trump,  on Christmas Day and, well, we threw up a little in our mouths trying to watch this.Basically, the spot is nothing but people fawning all over Trump for all the stuff he hasn t actually done. The ad includes a scene with a little girl thanking Trump for bringing back  Merry Christmas,  which never went away (there are even videos of President Obama saying  Merry Christmas  himself). A man thanks him for cutting his taxes. And America First says that everyday Americans everywhere are thanking Trump for being such a great and awesome president.The best president.Nobody s ever done what he s done. He s breaking all kinds of records every day.Believe us.Anyway, the word  propaganda  comes to mind when watching this. That s what it is   literal propaganda promoting someone who shouldn t need this kind of promotion anymore. Watch this ad bullshit below:The way the MAGAs are kowtowing to Orange Hitler is both disgusting and frightening. The man has done nothing, and his policies will harm the very same Americans who are thanking him. Unfortunately, it will take an obscene amount of pain before they ll open their eyes and see they ve been duped by a con man with a bad hairdo.And his ongoing need for this kind of adoration is, at best, unbecoming of his office.

" Papa Johnâ€™s Founder Retires, Figures Out Racism Is Bad For Business","A centerpiece of Donald Trump s campaign, and now his presidency, has been his white supremacist ways. That is why so many of the public feuds he gets into involve people of color. One of his favorite targets, is, of course, the players in the National Football League who dare to exercise their First Amendment rights by kneeling during the national anthem in protest of racist police brutality. Well, there is one person who has figured out that racism is bad for business, even if it did get the orange overlord elected: The founder of the pizza chain Papa John s.This is a man who has never been on the right side of history on any number of issues, and plus his pizza sucks. But, when he decided to complain about the players protesting, his sales really dropped. Turns out racism doesn t pay, and we all know that corporations are all about the bottom line. Therefore, Papa John Schnatter will no longer be CEO of the hack pizza chain.BREAKING: Papa John's founder John Schnatter to step down as CEO; announcement comes weeks after he criticized NFL over protests.  AP Business News (@APBusiness) December 21, 2017The thing is, while people are certainly allowed to have political opinions, they have to realize that those opinions can often come with dire consequences   especially if one is in the business of trying to garner sales and support from any and all people, which one would presume is the goal of all CEO s. No one knows whether or not the pressure from his shareholders, the public outcry or boycotts, or even the NFL itself had anything to do with his stepping down. As of right now, all we know is that he will be gone, and perhaps the future CEO will run a company that is inclusive of the diverse fabric that we call America. After all, the guiding symbol of this nation will always be the Statue of Liberty, and bigots like Trump and Schnatter are the past. The rest of us are the future. We just have to survive the present to get there.Featured image via Rob Kim/Getty Images",News
 WATCH: Paul Ryan Just Told Us He Doesnâ€™t Care About Struggling Families Living In Blue States,"Republicans are working overtime trying to sell their scam of a tax bill to the public as something that directly targets middle-class and working-class families with financial relief. Nothing could be further from the truth, and they re getting hammered on that repeatedly. Speaking on CNBC, Paul Ryan was going full throttle, trying to convince us that the paltry savings we re getting is actually wait for it big money.But he didn t just go with the usual talking points. With a smug look that only someone who grew up in a wealthy family can muster when talking about that which he does not know, Ryan claimed that the $2,059 more per year that families living paycheck-to-paycheck will see is extremely significant. Then he decided he had to amend that to say such savings might be nothing to a family earning $600,000 per year (true), or for people living in New York or California (false).Those are the same two states that Trump s loyal subjects insist on stripping from the 2016 vote totals to claim that Trump actually won the popular vote. Watch Ryan completely dismiss all the struggling families living in blue states below:If you re living paycheck-to-paycheck which is more than half of the people in this country and you got #2059more from a tax cut next year, that s not nothing. pic.twitter.com/8TKtrMqRa1  Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) December 21, 2017Someone needs to reach through their computer or television and wipe that smugness off his face.

 Bad News For Trump â€” Mitch McConnell Says No To Repealing Obamacare In 2018,"Republicans have had seven years to come up with a viable replacement for Obamacare but they failed miserably. After taking a victory lap for gifting the wealthy with a tax break on Wednesday, Donald Trump looked at the cameras and said,  We have essentially repealed Obamacare and we will come up with something that will be much better. Obamacare has been repealed in this bill,  he added. Well, like most things Trump says, that s just not true. But, if the former reality show star could have done that in order to eradicate former President Obama s signature legislation, he would have and without offering an alternative.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told NPR that  This has not been a very bipartisan year. I hope in the new year, we re going to pivot here and become more cooperative. An Obamacare repeal in 2018 is DOA. Well, we obviously were unable to completely repeal and replace with a 52-48 Senate,  the Kentucky Republican said.  We ll have to take a look at what that looks like with a 51-49 Senate. But I think we ll probably move on to other issues. NPR reports:McConnell hopes to focus instead on stabilizing the insurance marketplaces to keep premiums from skyrocketing in the early months of 2018, a promise he made to moderate Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine to get her support for the tax bill.On top of that McConnell broke with House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on the approach to paring back spending on programs like Medicaid and food stamps. McConnell told NPR he is  not interested  in using Senate budget rules to allow Republicans to cut entitlements without consultation with Democrats. I think entitlement changes, to be sustained, almost always have to be bipartisan,  McConnell said.  The House may have a different agenda. If our Democratic friends in the Senate want to join us to tackle any kind of entitlement reform. I d be happy to take a look at it. This is coming from Mitch McConnell. He knows Donald Trump is destroying the GOP. It doesn t matter, Sen. McConnell. We still recall him saying that his  number one priority is making sure president Obama s a one-term president. Well, we re hoping that Trump doesn t last a full term. Funny how that works.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News
" WATCH: Lindsey Graham Trashes Media For Portraying Trump As â€˜Kooky,â€™ Forgets His Own Words","The media has been talking all day about Trump and the Republican Party s scam of a tax bill; as well as the sheer obsequiousness of Trump s cabinet, and then members of Congress, after their tax scam was all but passed. But the media isn t quite saying what Trump wants. They ve been doing analysis and discussion all day long rather than praising it for the grand achievement Trump believes it is. The GOP has increasingly sounded exactly like Trump when it comes to media coverage, and coverage of the tax scam is no different. Coverage of Trump in general hasn t changed.Today, Lindsey Graham went after the media for portraying Trump as a  kook,  and unfit for office (they wouldn t be doing their job if they weren t telling the truth, though). Graham said: You know what concerns me about the American press is this endless, endless attempt to label the guy as some kind of kook; not fit to be president. Jake Tapper notes that he himself has never labeled Trump that way. But then he points out something rather odd about Graham s opinion.

 Heiress To Disney Empire Knows GOP Scammed Us â€“ SHREDS Them For Tax Bill,"Abigail Disney is an heiress with brass ovaries who will profit from the GOP tax scam bill but isn t into f-cking poor people over. Ms. Disney penned an op-ed for USA Today in which she rips the GOP a new one because she has  always been cognizant of income and wealth inequality.  In other words, she is not Donald Trump, Paul Ryan or Bob Corker. Or Mitch McConnell. She is Abigail Disney, dammit. Since the election of Ronald Reagan, the gap between rich and poor has grown dramatically and  trickle down  economics has turned out to cause more of a trickle up,  she writes.  But nothing has brought the problem of inequality into sharper focus for me than the current proposals by Republicans to overhaul the tax system. Disney says that this proposal will be burdensome to the middle class while decreasing  the responsibility of the wealthy to contribute to the common good. And then she dropped a truth bomb. (We like truth bombs.)Republicans insist this plan will cut taxes for the middle class, but the truth is that any meager savings will be offset by losses elsewhere   in deductions no longer allowed, loss of Medicaid and Medicare coverage, and less funding for education, all of which are on the chopping block in order to provide a tax cut for a few very wealthy people like me. There is even a tax break to private jet owners. This bill will give me this tax cut while also killing health insurance for over 13 million people,  Disney wrote.  It will let me pass over $20 million to my children, tax-free. And all my friends with private jets? They get a tax cut too. With a suffocating education system, a dying infrastructure and a national debt that will be at least $1.5 trillion bigger, that social mobility will be far out of reach for people like you,  Disney continued.  But I will be able to stay comfortably right where I am. Does that strike you as fair? No, it does not, thankyouverymuch. But given how this bill was written, I think it s looking a lot like a nightmare from Pirates of the Caribbean,  Disney wrote.  Have I made you angry yet? I really hope I ve made you angry. You should be. No one who votes for this tax bill will be voting with your life in mind. But you will pay for it.

 Tone Deaf Trump: Congrats Rep. Scalise On Losing Weight After You Almost Died,"Donald Trump just signed the GOP tax scam into law. Of course, that meant that he invited all of his craven, cruel GOP sycophants down from their perches on Capitol Hill to celebrate in the Rose Garden at the White House. Now, that part is bad enough   celebrating tax cuts for a bunch of rich hedge fund managers and huge corporations at the expense of everyday Americans. Of course, Trump is beside himself with glee, as this represents his first major legislative win since he started squatting in the White House almost a year ago. Thanks to said glee, in true Trumpian style, he gave a free-wheeling address, and a most curious subject came up as Trump was thanking the goons from the Hill. Somehow, Trump veered away from tax cuts, and started talking about the Congressional baseball shooting that happened over the summer.In that shooting, Rep. Steve Scalise, who is also the House Majority Whip, was shot and almost lost his life. Thanks to this tragic and stunning act of political violence, Scalise had a long recovery; in fact he is still in physical therapy. But, of course, vain and looks-obsessed Trump decided that he would congratulate Scalise, not on his survival and on his miraculous recovery, but on the massive amount of weight Scalise lost while he was practically dying. And make no mistake   Scalise is VERY lucky to be alive. According to doctors, when he arrived at the hospital, Scalise was actually, quote, in  imminent risk of death.  Here is the quote, via Twitter:How stunningly tone deaf does one have to be to say something like that? I never thought I d say this about a Republican that I, by all reasonable accounts, absolutely loathe, but I feel sorry for him. I am sorry he got shot, and I am even sorrier that he now has to stand there and listen to that orange buffoon talk about him like that.I am sure that Scalise is a much tougher man than Trump, though. I am equally sure that he also knows that Trump is an international embarrassment and a crazy man who never should have been allowed anywhere near the White House.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News

 Mueller Spokesman Just F-cked Up Donald Trumpâ€™s Christmas,"Trump supporters and the so-called president s favorite network are lashing out at special counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI. The White House is in panic-mode after Mueller obtained tens of thousands of transition team emails as part of the Russian probe. Ironically, it will quite possibly be emails that brings Trump down.A lawyer for the Trump transition team is claiming that the emails had been illegally turned over by the General Services Administration because the account owners never received notification of the request and he s claiming that they were  privileged communications. In a letter, Trump s attorney requested that Congress  act immediately to protect future presidential transitions from having their private records misappropriated by government agencies, particularly in the context of sensitive investigations intersecting with political motives. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr defended the special counsel s work in a statement issued just past midnight on Sunday, several hours after claims of   unlawful conduct  by Trump s attorney were made, according to Politico. When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner s consent or appropriate criminal process,  he said.The words that pop out in the statement are  criminal investigation,  the  account owner s consent  and  criminal process. While on the campaign trail, Donald Trump asked Russians to hack Hillary Clinton s emails. After the election, Trump s team is claiming that Mueller obtained the transition teams  emails illegally, even though that s not the truth. We see a pattern here.Team Trump thought Mueller was on a fishing expedition. Turns out, he was actually reeling in the fish. The White House was not aware at the time that he had the emails. Mueller got them through GSA so that team Trump could not selectively leave any out if they were requested.Merry Christmas, Mr. Trump.Photo by Ann Heisenfelt/Getty Images.",News
 SNL Hilariously Mocks Accused Child Molester Roy Moore For Losing AL Senate Race (VIDEO),"Right now, the whole world is looking at the shocking fact that Democrat Doug Jones beat Republican Roy Moore in the special election to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the United States Senate. Of course, Moore s candidacy was rocked by allegations of sexually harassing and even molesting teenage girls   and being banned from the mall in his hometown of Gadsden, Alabama for doing so.Even before that, Moore was an incendiary character in Alabama politics, having been removed as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court not once but twice, and having made statements such as Muslims should not be allowed in Congress and homosexuality should be illegal. Hell, he even said that the last time America was great was when we had slavery. Therefore, he was an extraordinarily damaged candidate as it was. However, despite all of this, Alabama is a deep red state, with many voters agreeing with some of Moore s more extreme positions, and some even insisting that the allegations of sexual misconduct were simply not true. That is why it was such a shock that Doug Jones pulled out a win for that Senate seat.Well, there is one entity that could not resist going all in on the fact that Roy Moore lost this race: Saturday Night Live. While doing a caricature of the results, SNL began, with its Weekend Update host Colin Jost brutally mocking Moore s alleged proclivities fore teen girls: Congratulations to Alabama s newest Senator   not Roy Moore. Doug Jones has become the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in Alabama in over 20 years. Said Roy Moore:  gross, over 20 years? Jost then got in a dig at Trump, for whom Moore s loss was  a humiliating failure, remind everyone what Trump said of Jones  win: The Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. It never ends! Indeed. If the sane people of America have anything to say about it, it will be a very, very long time after 2018 before the GOP is allowed to control anything. Jost continued mocking Trump: That s it? You just went all in for an accused pedophile and when he lost, [you re] just like,  well, we had fun! He could be removed from office tonight and tweet:  Congratulations to Robert Mueller on a great investigation. Had a fun time being president. Catch you on the flippity-flop! #DietCokeTime . Oh, if only that could be our reality, to have Trump congratulating Mueller for removing him and his entire treasonous, criminal administration. Until then, we ll have to stick to  Weekend Update  and the rest of SNL, and hope for the best.Watch the video below:Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News

" In A Heartless Rebuke To Victims, Trump Invites NRA To Xmas Party On Sandy Hook Anniversary","It almost seems like Donald Trump is trolling America at this point. In the beginning, when he tried to gaslight the country by insisting that the crowd at his inauguration was the biggest ever   or that it was even close to the last couple of inaugurations   we all kind of scratched our heads and wondered what kind of bullshit he was playing at. Then when he started appointing people to positions they had no business being in, we started to worry that this was going to go much worse than we had expected.After 11 months of Donald Trump pulling the rhetorical equivalent of whipping his dick out and slapping it on every table he gets near, I think it s time we address what s happening: Dude is a straight-up troll. He gets pleasure out of making other people uncomfortable or even seeing them in distress. He actively thinks up ways to piss off people he doesn t like.Let s set aside just for a moment the fact that that s the least presidential  behavior anyone s ever heard of   it s dangerous.His latest stunt is one of the grossest yet.Everyone is, by now, used to Trump not talking about things he doesn t want to talk about, and making a huge deal out of things that not many people care about. So it wasn t a huge surprise when the president didn t discuss the Sandy Hook shooting of 2012 on the fifth anniversary of that tragic event. What was a huge surprise was that he not only consciously decided not to invite the victims  families to the White House Christmas party this year   as they have been invited every year since the massacre took place, along with others who share those concerns.In each of the past 4 years, President Obama invited gun violence prevention activists, gun violence survivors (including the Sandy Hook families) and supportive lawmakers to his Christmas party. Zero gun lobbyists were in attendance. pic.twitter.com/QePW9FtbSh  Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) December 15, 2017The last sentence of that tweet is important, because that s exactly who Donald Trump did invite to the White House Christmas party. Instead of victims. On the anniversary day.Yesterday was the 5 year mark of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook School, which went unacknowledged by the President. On the same day, he hosted a White House Christmas party to which he invited @NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre. Here he is at the party with @DanPatrick. pic.twitter.com/mUbKCIWGxB  Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) December 15, 2017Wayne LaPierre is the man who, in response to the Sandy Hook massacre, finally issued a statement that blamed gun violence on music, movies, and video games, and culminated with perhaps the greatest bit of irony any man has ever unintentionally conceived of: Isn t fantasizing about killing people as a way to get your kicks really the filthiest form of pornography? Yes. Yes, it is, Wayne.Anyway, Happy Holidays Merry Christmas from Donald Trump, everyone!Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News
 KY GOP State Rep. Commits Suicide Over Allegations He Molested A Teen Girl (DETAILS),"In this #METOO moment, many powerful men are being toppled. It spans many industries, from entertainment, to journalism, to politics and beyond. Any man that ever dared to abuse his power to sexually harass, molest, or assault women better brace himself for being rooted out, publicly shamed, and forced into early retirement.Well, unfortunately, the latest bombshell story has actually resulted in the suicide of a lawmaker. Kentucky State Representative Dan Johnson left a suicide note on Facebook and then shot himself on a bridge, according to reports from local authorities. Bullitt County Sheriff Donnie Tinnell reported to local station WDRB that Johnson s body was found after his suicide note from Facebook was reported to the local police. Here is that note:Now, nobody wants to celebrate a suicide. This man should have resigned gracefully and faced his accuser, who was a friend of his daughter s, who says that Johnson molested her while she was passed out drunk in his home. Apparently, Johnson, who referred to himself as some kind of  pope,  routinely engaged in parties with plenty of alcohol with minors. Johnson s home was called the  Pope s House,  and he was the preacher at the Heart of Fire City Church, where the alleged molestation took place.Now, innocent until proven guilty and all of that, but if someone commits suicide, it s likely there could be some merit there. That s a rather extreme measure to take. Further, by all accounts, this guy was no saint. He was heavily pro-gun, opposed any and all abortion rights, and has referred to President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as monkeys on his Facebook page, among other racist messages and images.Again, we re not glad the man is dead. But, it is important for people to remember him for exactly who he was. We grieve for the loss his children, wife, and grandchildren suffered, for nobody deserves such a loss. However, methinks the people of Kentucky are much better off. Sad to say, but true.Featured image via screen capture",News
 Meghan McCain Tweets The Most AMAZING Response To Doug Jonesâ€™ Win In Deep-Red Alabama,"As a Democrat won a Senate seat in deep-red Alabama, social media offered up everyone s opinion because that s what social media does. Democrat Doug Jones narrowly defeated accused pedophile and serial sexual assaulter Roy Moore in a special election for the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he was appointed Attorney General. And some Republicans aren t exactly heartbroken about this.Take Meghan McCain   John McCain s daughter. She went right after one of Trump s biggest supporters Steve Bannon as soon as the election results were announced:Suck it, Bannon  Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) December 13, 2017Three simple words. It s amazing what three simple words can say.Steve Bannon spoke at Moore s election night rally, which we assume was supposed to be a night of celebration. Bannon endorsed Moore early on, against Luther Strange, whom Donald Trump himself campaigned for earlier this year. Bannon s support for Moore remained steadfast even in the wake of multiple allegations surfaced against him of sexual assault, harassment and even pedophilia. Bannon even said,  There s a special place in hell  for those who refuse to support Moore.On Dec. 12, the people of Alabama rejected Roy Moore s penchant for pursuing, even assaulting, teenage girls. They rejected his hate and bigotry. They rejected an asshat who has been removed from Alabama s Supreme Court twice for violating federal court orders, thus demonstrating he has no respect for the rule of law. And they sent a message to the Republican Party that this bullshit will no longer be tolerated. If deep-red Alabama can elect a Democrat, then anyone can. And that should have Republicans scared out of their minds.Well, we re going there, along with Meghan McCain and anyone else who believed Moore shouldn t ever hold public office. Even Republicans have their limits, it seems.Featured image via Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images",News
 CNN CALLS IT: A Democrat Will Represent Alabama In The Senate For The First Time In 25 Years,"Alabama is a notoriously deep red state. It s a place where Democrats always think that we have zero chances of winning   especially in statewide federal elections. However, that is just what happened on Tuesday night in the Special Election to replace Senator Jeff Sessions. Doug Jones, the Democratic Senate candidate who is known in the state for prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan members who bombed a church during the Civil Rights Movement and killed four little African American girls, will be the next Senator from Alabama. CNN has just called the race, as there seems no more GOP-leaning counties out there.To contrast, Roy Moore had been twice removed from the Alabama Supreme Court as Chief Justice for violating the law, and was also credibly accused of being a sexual predator toward teen girls. Despite all of that, though, the race was a nail biter, because Moore has a long history and a deep base in Alabama. Of course, decent people   including Republicans   were horrified at the idea of a man like Roy Moore going to the Senate. Despite the allegations of sexual predation, Moore also had said many incendiary things, such as putting forth the idea that Muslims shouldn t be allowed in Congress, that homosexuality should be illegal, and that America was great when slavery was legal. And that s just for starters, too.Thank you Alabama, for letting sanity prevail in this race. Oh, and a message to Democrats   this is proof we can compete everywhere. Get a fifty state strategy going so we can blow the GOP outta the water in 2018.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News
 White House: It Wasnâ€™t Sexist For Trump To Slut-Shame Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (VIDEO),"A backlash ensued after Donald Trump launched a sexist rant against Kirsten Gillibrand Thursday morning, saying that the Democratic Senator  would do anything  for a campaign contribution. Trump was calling Gillibrand a whore.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders somehow denied that Trump s tweet was sexist. There is no way that is sexist at all,  Sanders told reporters.Then Sanders tried to explain what Trump really meant (we all know what he really meant). According to Sanders, Trump was merely accusing Gillibrand of being  controlled by contributions,  and hammering home his pledge to  drain the swamp  in Washington, according to The Hill. I think that the president is very obvious,  she said.  This is the same sentiment the president has expressed many times before when he has exposed the corruption of the entire political system. Sanders claims that Trump does not owe Gillibrand an apology if his words were taken as sexist. I think only if your mind is in the gutter you would have read it that way, so no,  she said.Watch:Gillibrand called on Trump to resign after Trump s accusers came back into the spotlight by hosting a press conference in which they called for an investigation into his past behavior.

Now, he has gone even lower with an attack on Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (NY).In an early morning tweet, Trump actually suggested that Senator Gillibrand would have sex with him for campaign money. No, I m not kidding. Here is the tweet:Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office  begging  for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump.

We already knew that Donald Trump was a sexist asshole, but this is a new low, even for him.General Kelly, General McMaster, and whomever else is running that White House   DO SOMETHING about this fool s Twitter habit.

Ivanka, Melania, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Hope Hicks, and all the other women in Trump s orbit need to step up and say that there s been more than enough. Curtail this man s sexist behavior, or turn in your woman card. Every last one of you.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News
 Accused Child Molesting Senate Candidate Roy Moore Sides With Putin Over Reagan (VIDEO),"Ronald Reagan is largely seen as the Messiah of the Republican Party. Despite how long it has been since the man was president, he has always remained the high standard of GOP morality for potential office holders. That is, until now. Reagan is likely rolling over in his grave at the idea of the state of his party with Donald Trump as its standard-bearer, and he s likely doing the same at the prospect of a bigoted accused child molester like Roy Moore (R-AL) being the next GOP Senator from Alabama. Well, now Reagan has another reason to hate Moore: He s clearly in the pocket of Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin just like Donald Trump is.During an interview where he s talking about Americans being the face of  evil  in the world right now, Moore indicates that Putin s harsh and murderous treatment of LGBTQ people in Russia is something he would like to see happen in the United States. Then, he does something most appalling, and goes on to give Putin a message in Russian. Now, no one knows where a bigoted, backwoods buffoon like Roy Moore would learn Russian. After all, he s barely left Alabama, where he has spent the last 40+ years wreacking havoc and just basically cementing Alabama s place as America s bigoted boil on the butt of humanity wherever and whenever he can. However, he managed to learn enough Russian to dog whistle to Putin in that interview. That should disturb us all. Not only is the man being a homophobe, a racist, a misogynist, and more than likely a child molester, he s also a Russian stooge.America, we can do better. We have enough Russian puppets at the highest levels of government. Lord knows we don t need one in the United States Senate.Watch the appalling video below:Please watch this until the end, Roy Moore sides with Putin over Reagan, says that America is the focus of evil in the world, and sends a nice message to Putin in Russian. pic.twitter.com/wFgDkvzEhT  The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) December 10, 2017Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News

The Fox host is trying to discredit the FBI and we re wondering where the  Blue Lives Matter  crowd is as she tries to take down law enforcement officials. On Saturday night, Pirro said there needs to be a  cleansing  at the FBI and the Department of Justice.Pirro claims that quite a few officials are protecting Hillary Clinton   who does not hold public office   or are destroying Donald Trump, and singled out Deputy Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe, FBI official Peter Strzok, former Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, former FBI Director James Comey and you guessed it: Special Counsel Robert Mueller   all of whom she says need to be arrested and placed in handcuffs. There have been times in our history where corruption and lawlessness were so pervasive, that examples had to be made,  she shrieked.  This is one of those times. There is a cleansing needed in our FBI and Department of Justice   it needs to be cleansed of individuals who should not just be fired. But who need to be taken out in cuffs,  Pirro declared.Watch:.@JudgeJeanine:  There have been times in our history where corruption and lawlessness were so pervasive, that examples had to be made.

For that, he was sentenced to spend over two years  locked up  in prison for improperly deducting $1.2 million of his personal expenses as business write-offs while living a lavish lifestyle. Mr. Pirro was convicted on all 34 counts.Pirro split with her hubby after he admitted to fathering a child with another woman. He told the press and Pirro failed to give him enough attention. I know! Maybe if he changed his name to Hillary Clinton then he d get all the attention he needs.Pirro s hatred for Hillary Clinton goes way back and it appears to stem from jealousy.Maybe Pirro should heed the advice from Pirro in 2016 when she said,  We cannot have a country run by a president subject to ongoing criminal investigations, potential indictments and never-ending hearings [W]hether she s indicted or even guilty, it doesn t matter.

 Liberal Group Trolls Trump At Roy Moore Rally In The Best Possible Way (VIDEO),"Donald Trump held a rally for Alabama Senate candidate and alleged pedophile Roy Moore in Pensacola, Florida on Friday night which he later claimed was  packed to the rafters  but the venue was barely half-filled with supporters.

I ve yet to see a valid explanation, and I have no reason to doubt the victims  accounts. Trump has given Moore his full support despite the Alabama Senate candidate being accused by multilple women of targeting them when they were teenagers and he was in this thirties and working as a district attorney.The truck was reportedly parked across the street from the rally, and was eventually driven around the crowd by American Bridge staffers, The Hill reports.Donald Trump has been accused of sexual harassment or assault by 19 women and yet, conservatives rewarded him by electing him to the highest seat in the land. Right-wing Alabama evangelicals seem to take no issue with Moore s scandalous past, which includes hating Muslims, the LGBTQ community, and allegedly creeping up on young girls.Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images.",News
" Don Jr. Tries To Mock Al Frankenâ€™s Resignation, Backfires Immediately","When Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) announced his plans to resign Thursday, he specifically called out Donald Trump over the Access Hollywood video and Roy Moore, an alleged pedophile who is running for the Senate seat in Alabama with the GOP s blessing. Donald Trump Jr., not known for being a brainiac, decided to mock Franken on Twitter as if he didn t listen to the Democrat s amazing speech. Junior invoked one of the former comedian s  Saturday Night Live  most well-known characters, writing,  because I m good enough, I m smart enough, and God-darnit people like me  and included the hashtag  #Franken. because I m good enough, I m smart enough, and God-darnit people like me. #Franken  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) December 7, 2017Twitter gave Junior a wake-up call:pic.twitter.com/NmuRm5MgMz  liberalgranny50 (@peppersandeggs) December 7, 2017I am sure daddy @realDonaldTrump can sympathize as he is a fellow sexual predator  pic.twitter.com/Qesftp1u28  Matt Slavin (@tHemAttsLavin) December 7, 2017 Grab  em by the pussy.

" BREAKING: Cop Finally Gets His Due, Walter Scottâ€™s Killer Sentenced To Prison (DETAILS)","In America, we have been having a conversation about police brutality against black Americans. Despite the countless black people murdered unjustly by police, there is usually no justice. Sandra Bland, Philando Castile, Keith Lamont Scott, Michael Brown, Freddie Gray too many to mention here, really. All of those people were senselessly murdered by cops who chose to be their judges, juries, and executioners, and they did so with impunity and without consequence. However, there is hope, and it is coming out of South Carolina, of all places.North Charleston police officer Michael Slager murdered Walter Scott, a black man who was fleeing after a routine traffic stop in cold blood in 2015. He would have gotten away with it, too, had it not been for a citizen who was brave enough to tape the murder. The tape showed that Slager had lied about his life being in danger, and it showed him cuffing Scott s lifeless body, and then planting a taser as  evidence.  Here is the news report of that damning tape:Thanks to that tape, Slager was arrested and charged with murder. Now, fast forward two years later, and Slager has been convicted of murder. U.S. District Judge David Norton decided to throw the book at Slager, and sentenced the murdering ex-cop to 19-24 years in prison.The original case ended in a mistrial, but the state of South Carolina seemed determined to get justice for Walter Scott, and that happened on December 7, 2017.  Of course, Slager s family begged for mercy from the judge, but luckily those calls were ignored. Michael Slager is a murderer, and he deserves the sentence he got.So many times, these cases end with the murderous cops back on the force, out in the streets after what amounts to nothing more than a paid vacation, free to murder another black person at will again. Thankfully, for once, the system worked as it should. For once, I am proud to be a South Carolinian. Hopefully this sets a precedent, and helps us turn a corner toward the arc of justice.Watch the video of the remarks of the Scott family below: Featured image via Grace Beahm-Pool/Getty Images",News
 Watch: Is This Proof Trump Is Unfit for Service?,"New questions are being asked about President Donald Trump s ability to lead after he slurred his words during a speech about his Jerusalem decision. Possible reasons for this include: fatigue, a dry mouth (the White House explanation), the use of drugs or alcohol, a problem with his dentures or more troubling issues dealing with his mental or physical health. Morning Joe reported this morning that, unlike other presidents, Trump has opted not to get his physicals at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.Questions about Trump s mental stability have been growing over the last few months. While he has never been viewed as a stable person in the traditional sense, his tweets and comments have gotten more erratic. He was widely criticized recently when he retweeted several anti-Muslim videos that were posted by radicals in the United Kingdom.One psychiatrist talk to MSNBC s Lawrence O Donnel about his impressions of Trump s state of mind.Many think that any degradation in Trump s mental state may be due to the increased pressure he is feeling from Robert Mueller s investigations into collusion between his campaign and the Russian government. This has increased since former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.All of this talk is leading to more people to ask if Trump should be removed from office, citing the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Rep. Jamie D. Raskin (D-MD) has circulated a  dear colleague  letter suggesting just that. As published in the Washington Post, it says: Please join a rapidly growing group of colleagues in cosponsoring H.R. 1987, the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity Act. It sets up and defines the Congressionally-appointed  body  called for by the 25th Amendment. Under Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, the Vice-President and a majority of the Cabinet or the Vice-President and a majority of  such other body as Congress may by law provide  can determine that the President is for reasons of physical or mental incapacity unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. The 25th Amendment was added to the Constitution in 1967, but in the last 50 years Congress never created the  body  that its language contemplated. Perhaps it never occurred to prior Congresses that setting up this body was necessary. For obvious reasons, it is indeed necessary, and now is the time for us to do it. While the Republicans in the Cabinet and Congress may not yet be ready to take this step, it is out there.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images",News
" Trump Completely SCREWS The Middle East Peace Process, Just Another Wednesday For Him","On Wednesday, Donald Trump took a step no previous president had ever dared to consider. He has declared that the United States now officially recognizes the city of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and announced plans to move the American embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city.The only problem is, the city isn t just holy to the country of Israel.While Trump indicated that he wasn t  taking a position  on any contested land, that s really a misleading statement, since declaring Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in effect gives the city to the Israelis, a position that essentially declares the debate on who all of the land belongs to over.Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator in the peace process, was quick to respond, saying that Trump had  destroyed any possibility of peace  and that he was  pushing this region towards chaos [and] violence. Mustafa Marghouti, an independent Palestinian politician, told Al-Jazeera that: This is not a single act. This US administration that did not speak even once about a two-state solution. This American administration did not say or mention the words  Palestinian state  once. This American administration has failed to exercise any pressure on Israel on the issue of settlements, although Israel has enhanced settlement activities in the occupied territories by no less than 100 percent since President Trump was elected. Many expect to see outrage across the Middle East as news of the decision comes in.The European Union, for their part, insists that their position has not changed, and issued a statement almost immediately declaring that they intended to continue working toward recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of two distinct states   Israel AND Palestine.Just as he does here at home, Trump seems to be uniting people against him, even some that seem to be unlikely pairings. Both the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and King Abdullah II of Jordan warned that ignoring the Palestinian, Muslim, and Christian rights in Jerusalem will only fuel further extremism and undermine the war against terrorism. But the decision does make Trump s evangelical supporters in America happy. Their desire to hasten the end of days has been a constant source of bafflement for those seeking to understand the strange relationship between the Jewish state and evangelicalism. According to Christian traditions, the Jews will all die in the Apocalypse, as will everyone who doesn t share their specific beliefs.No wonder they re mostly Republicans.Watch Trump s announcement here:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News
 Trump Only Cares About Trump; Why He Is Recognizing Jerusalem Today,"President Donald Trump announced yesterday that he plans to formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While this is left most pundits perplexed, the reasoning is clear. Trump wants to divert attention from Robert Mueller s investigation. It is no coincidence that the day after the news broke that Deutsche Bank has received subpoenas for information on the Trump family s assets, that this Jerusalem decision was announced. What could be a bigger news story than getting this information? A blow up in the Middle East.Look at the reaction world leaders have had to this announcement. American allies throughout the Middle East and Europe have asked Trump not to do this and have stressed how dangerous a statement this is. US News and World Report put this out today: The mere consideration of Trump changing the status quo sparked a renewed U.S. security warning on Tuesday. America s consulate in Jerusalem ordered U.S. personnel and their families to avoid visiting Jerusalem s Old City or the West Bank, and urged American citizens in general to avoid places with increased police or military presence. It is worth noting that while Trump will formally announce that the U.S. will recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, there is no movement underway to relocate the embassy from Tel Aviv. In fact, he has signed an order to delay that decision for another six months. This move is necessary due to the 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act, which mandated the embassy be moved. It also allowed the president to delay that by six months and every president since that act became law has done so this way.The Atlantic has even compared this decision to Trump  wagging the dog,  a reference to a movie where a U.S. president goes to war with Albania to take the public s attention away from his own scandals involving a mistress. The film was viewed as a parody of President Bill Clinton s military actions in Afghanistan and Sudan after he acknowledged an affair with Monica Lewinsky.While whether or not Clinton attacked other countries to distract the nation from his actions with Lewinsky may be a point that is up for debate, it is clear that Trump likes to do things to distract the public s attention. Catherine Rampell wrote about this tactic late last year in the Washington Post. She wrote: Welcome to 2017, the ouroboros of distractions, where every terrible thing is a head-fake for a ruse for a diversion for a misdirection from something else much, much worse. Trump makes announcements, sends tweets and says things without any thought to the real world consequences that follow. Experts in the Middle East fear that the Jerusalem announcement will lead to real deaths. Many people worry  that his thoughtless and impetuous tweets will lead to a nuclear war. His thoughtless comments confuse and enrage many.By making such a move, for such purely personal reasons, Trump is proving, once again, that he is not fit to be president of a condo association, much less of the United States.Featured image by Andrew Burton/Getty Images.",News
 Watch: Trump Supporting Coal CEO Upset Trump Is Wiping Out â€˜Thousandsâ€™ Of Coal Mining Jobs,"While on the campaign trail, Donald Trump promised to revive the coal industry and after he took power, he signed an executive order rolling back a temporary ban on mining coal and a stream protection rule that was imposed by the Obama administration. Trump vowed to bring back thousands of mining jobs in struggling rural areas.  I made them this promise,  Trump said,  we will put our miners back to work. That was then and this is now.Coal CEO Robert Murray, a fierce supporter of Trump s, warns that if the Senate version of tax reform is enacted by the current occupant of the White House, he will be destroying thousands of coal mining jobs in the process.Murray said the Senate legislation will raise Murray Energy s taxes by $60 million a year,  notwithstanding the other so-called benefits the Senate has proposed,  CNBC reports. This means that very capital-intensive, highly leveraged employers, like coal-mining companies, will be forced out of business, with tragic consequences for our families and for many regions of our country,  Murray said. We won t have enough cash flow to exist. It wipes us out,  Murray told CNNMoney in an interview on Tuesday. This wipes out everything that President Trump has done for coal,  said Murray, the head of one of America s largest coal companies.CNN reports:Murray warned that a bankruptcy of his Ohio-based company would hurt its 5,500 employees along with their families. Asked if other coal mining companies could go out of business, he said:  Most certainly. Watch:Murray hosted a fundraiser for Trump during the campaign. And today, Murray warns that the GOP tax plan will  wipe out  coal mining jobs.Who saw this coming? Besides all of us. Trump supporters have been suckered.Image via screen capture. ",News
" Sitting GOP Senator Has Had ENOUGH, Donates To Alabama Democrat For Senate (IMAGE)","Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake has never been a fan of Donald Trump or his incendiary, divisive brand of politics. Now, he is a leading GOP voice against electing Roy Moore (R-AL) to the United States Senate. Moore is an accused child molester, and has a lifetime history of making all kinds of bigoted and incendiary comments. He has said that homosexuality should be illegal, and that Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress. Moore was also removed twice from the Alabama Supreme Court for refusing to comply with higher court rulings. Well, Flake has finally had enough of his party enabling characters like Moore. He had already said that if he lived in Alabama, he d be voting for Democrat Doug Jones. Now, Flake  has taken his support of Jones even further, in the wake of the Republican National Committee s decision to support an accused child molester rather than a Democrat.Taking to Twitter, Senator Flake posted an image of a check   made out to Doug Jones  Senate campaign. Here is the tweet, captioned  Country over Party :Country over Party pic.twitter.com/JZMTaEYdxQ  Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) December 5, 2017Now, I don t agree with Jeff Flake on anything politically, but I can say that he is trying to act with morality and decency here. One could argue that Flake s plans to retire from the Senate mean that he can do this without consequence, but at this point, that matters not. We do not need a pedophile in the United States Senate, and the GOP apparatus should be ashamed of themselves for trying to get Roy Moore elected. But, hey   better a pedophile than a Democrat, right?Featured image Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News
 Republican National Committee: Better A Pedophile Than A Democrat In The U.S. Senate,"By now, the whole world knows that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore (R-Of Course) was banned from an Alabama mall and the YMCA for creeping on little girls. He has been accused of molesting young girls as young as age fourteen. Of course, when the allegations first came out and the uproar and backlash began, everyone, regardless of politics, reacted with outrage. However, the GOP s outrage was often much more muted. Further, it took awhile for the Republican National Committee to pull their support for Moore, despite the deeply disturbing allegations of his being a pedophile. Well, now that the rage has died down, the RNC is back with a new message regarding this Senate race: Better a pedophile than a Democrat.Under cover of night, the RNC reinstated their support for Roy Moore, and an RNC official confirmed to The Hill that, quote, We can confirm our involvement in the Alabama Senate race. So, there you have it, folks. They literally want a child molester in the United States Senate rather than a Democrat. There are only a few voices from the right who are being brave on this one   and none of them are seeking re-election. Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney tweeted that the GOP must not tolerate Moore:Roy Moore in the US Senate would be a stain on the GOP and on the nation. Leigh Corfman and other victims are courageous heroes. No vote, no majority is worth losing our honor, our integrity.  Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) December 4, 2017Outgoing Arizona GOP Senator Jeff Flake has actually said that he would vote for the Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, if he lived in Alabama, and former Jeb Bush adviser Tim Miller has actually endorsed and donated to Jones. Outgoing Pennsylvania moderate Republican Charlie Dent said he never supported Moore in the first place. Here s the video of Dent s takedown of Moore:There is also outspoken Trump critic and longtime GOP strategist Steve Schmidt, who went on national television and called Moore a pedophile:Other than that, though, it has been radio silence. After all, they need that vote. Besides, let s face it   the GOP writ large showed America and the world what they stand for when they elected Donald Trump.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News
 Donald Trumpâ€™s Eating Habits Could Be Dramatically Affecting His Wellbeing And Our Safety,"We ve all heard the stories of Donald Trump preferring a well-done steak with ketchup and shunning any new delicacies, despite living a lifestyle that offers him all the luxuries one could ever desire, however, it s not just that the President has terrible gastronomical taste, a new memoir suggests that his diet is one of several poor lifestyle choices that could very well shorten his life.According to an excerpt from Let Trump be Trump, an upcoming book by Trump s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and aide David Bossie, we get to enter the inner circle where the President of the United States having a 2,400-calorie McDonald s dinner is par for the course. Trump s appetite seems to know no bounds when it comes to McDonald s, with a dinner order consisting of two Big Macs, two Filet-O-Fish, and a chocolate malted,  is just one of the claims made in the book. To put that meal in perspective, Trump s dinner contains 3,400 grams of sodium, despite the American Heart Foundation recommending just 1,500 grams per day, plus enough white bread to last most people a week. Remember, this is just one meal, but it only gets worse. On Trump Force One there were four major food groups: McDonald s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, pizza, and Diet Coke,  the authors write about traveling with Trump during the early days of his presidency, but there may be a valid reason for it   Not only is he a fan of manufacturing, Trump is also a renowned germaphobe who allegedly won t eat from a package that has already been opened, which would also explain the plane s cupboards being stacked with Vienna Fingers, potato chips, pretzels, and many packages of Oreos.  Those well-done steaks make a little more sense now, as well. But a little bit of bacteria is probably the least of the President s worries. This is a 71-year-old man who gets next to no exercise (it s hard to include his golf when he barely even walks while playing), gets very little sleep, and is constantly throwing tantrums, so add in that diet and you have the perfect recipe for a heart attack. The diet alone, especially the snacks, is almost an open-invite for diabetes, too.What makes this frightening for the rest of us is that this is a man who is currently responsible for a nuclear standoff with North Korea, as well as dealing with rapidly warming oceans and an ever-increasing tax bill. If he has this lack of concern for his own wellbeing, then what does it say of his risk-assessment abilities?Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News

So what was McCain s approach to gaining those new followers?

John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) December 4, 2017There was just one little thing Senator McCain had forgotten to factor in   His significantly waning popularity since he voted for the Republican tax bill. Being the Republican Senator for Arizona, some may have seen this as him just batting for his own team, but let s not forget that John McCain was one of the few glimmers of hope as he was also one of the only Republicans that has been openly critical of President Trump and this is a terrible tax bill.Not only will the new tax measures raise taxes on those earning less than $75,000 per annum, it would also take healthcare from 13 million Americans and raise the national debt by almost $1.5 trillion dollars over the coming decade! To add insult to injury, the 479-page bill wasn t even completed when it was released on Friday night, with some pages crossed out and others with hand-written amendments in the margins. Furthermore, nobody even had a chance to read it when they were forced to vote on it, but that didn t sway McCain and the bill somehow managed to pass the Senate.UPDATE: Senate Republicans are so desperate to pass their tax bill tonight that they're now making handwritten changes to their already handwritten changes Seriously. pic.twitter.com/KQfW7bOyk1  Senator Dick Durbin (@SenatorDurbin) December 2, 2017Some people had grown to believe that Senator McCain wasn t too bad for a Republican, but when he shocked everyone and voted in favor of the new tax bill, one where 13 million taxpayers will lose their healthcare but still subsidize his treatment for brain cancer, he proved he was no different and people decided to revolt. So when McCain put out the plea for another 74 followers to reach the three million mark, Twitter-users instead instigated a massive unfollow campaign using the hashtag #UnfollowMcCain, costing him hundreds of followers every minute.Over 5,000 people have unfollowed you since you sent this this two hours ago.One reason is you because you   a man undergoing cancer treatment   voted to strip $25 BILLION dollars from the part of Medicare which pays for CANCER TREATMENT.#unfollowmccain https://t.co/gWl6KsAaLE  Mikel Jollett (@Mikel_Jollett) December 4, 2017I m happy to report that @SenJohnMcCain has lost more than 10,000 followers since I posted the below tweet.

Of course, the good folks at Saturday Night Live, who have been mocking Trump relentlessly, couldn t resist using this to needle the notoriously thin -skinned, sorry excuse for a  president.  It also helps that we are in the midst of the holiday season, which enabled SNL to use a seasonal classic, A Christmas Carol, to poke fun at Trump.Alec Baldwin took up the mantle to play Trump again, who is visited by a fictional Michael Flynn (Mikey Day) in chains, and seems positively terrified of the Ghost of Michael Flynn, who appears to tell Trump, it s time to come clean for the good of the country.  After that, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future line up to torture Trump in the Oval Office.The Ghost of Christmas Past is fired NBC host Billy Bush (Alex Moffat), of Trump s infamous  grab em by the pussy  tape. Then it was time for a shirtless Vladimir Putin (Beck Bennet) to arrive, to remind Trump of the fact that he wouldn t be president without help from the Russian government, and that he s about to have all of their efforts be for naught. The Ghost of Christmas Future is the best of all, with a positively wickedly delicious version of Hillary Clinton, played by Kate McKinnon, who gleefully says to Trump: You Donald, have given me the greatest Christmas gift of all! You have no idea how long I ve wanted to say this,  lock him up! Lock him up indeed. This entire criminal administration belongs in jail. It will go from Flynn, to Pence, to Trump Jr., and then to Trump himself   and then Hillary will really have the last laugh.",News
 Leaked Email Proves Trump Officials Aware Russia Had â€˜Thrown The USA Electionâ€™ To Trump,"Donald Trump s current deputy national security adviser K.T. McFarland, a former Fox News personality, K. T. McFarland admitted in an email to a colleague during the 2016 presidential transition to Russia throwing the election to Trump. The leaked email was written just weeks before Trump s inauguration and it states that sanctions would make it difficult to ease relations with Russia,  which has just thrown the U.S.A. election to him. The New York Times reports:But emails among top transition officials, provided or described to The New York Times, suggest that Mr. Flynn was far from a rogue actor. In fact, the emails, coupled with interviews and court documents filed on Friday, showed that Mr. Flynn was in close touch with other senior members of the Trump transition team both before and after he spoke with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, about American sanctions against Russia.A White House lawyer tried to explain McFarland s email to the The Times by saying that she was referring to the Democrats  portrayal of the election. That doesn t make any sense, by the way.McFarland wrote the email to Thomas P. Bossert, who currently serves as Trump s homeland security adviser, then he forwarded it to future National Security Advisor Michael Flynn (now indicted), future Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, future senior strategist Stephen Bannon, and future press secretary Sean Spicer, the Daily Beast reports.With all the pearl-clutching we witnessed from conservatives about Hillary Clinton s emails, you d think they wouldn t be sending messages about Russia throwing the election to Trump.This past March, John Oliver, the host of the HBO comedy show Last Week Tonight started a segment called  Stupid Watergate,  which he described as  a scandal with all the potential ramifications of Watergate, but where everyone involved is stupid and bad at everything.

 Trump Just Admitted He Knew Flynn Lied To The FBI Before He Asked Comey To Drop The Investigation,"Donald Trump really should have taken his staffers  advise and not tweeted about former national security adviser Michael Flynn because the former reality show star just implicated himself.

There is not a legal issue but rather a trust issue,  he said at the time.After Flynn left, Trump defended him, calling the disgraced former national security adviser a  wonderful man. I think he s been treated very, very unfairly by the media   as I call it, the fake media, in many cases,  Trump said in February.  I think it s really a sad thing he was treated so badly. When Flynn resigned, he apologized for giving an inaccurate assessment of his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to Mike Pence, who, at the time, was the vice-president elect.Pence then said that Flynn had not discussed sanctions with Kislyak.The day after Flynn resigned, Trump, according to then-FBI Director James Comey, asked him to  let go  of an investigation into Flynn.Trump admitted that he knew Flynn lied to the FBI, then he asked Comey to drop the investigation. Shorter version: Trump just tripped over his own little d*ck and presented exhibit A for trial because he obstructed justice.Photo by Steve Pope/Getty Images.",News
 Watch This Awesome Mashup of Michael Flynn Leading The â€˜Lock Her Upâ€™ Chant As He Goes Off To Court (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s disgraced National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has just plead guilty to lying to the FBI   a felony. He has also agreed to testify against Trump in exchange for leniency from Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team. The irony here is beyond delicious   especially since Flynn infamously led the  LOCK HER UP!  chants at the 2016 Republican National Convention, saying that Hillary Clinton was some kind of criminal, and that if Trump was elected they d be able to put her in jail, where many Trump supporters believe she belongs. Well, now the tables are turned, and it is Flynn who will be heading to jail, and the people who realize who the REAL criminals are have been having a field day. Perhaps one of the best pieces of Twitter schaudenfraude is this video of Flynn heading into court to plead guilty with the  Lock her up!  chant being played:I mashed up Michael Flynn s perp walk with audio of him leading a  lock her up  chant. pic.twitter.com/L1o5CjJXrQ  Adam Smith (@asmith83) December 1, 2017This is BEYOND awesome.

Michael Flynn is going to sing like a canary so that he can keep himself and his equally criminal son out of federal prison   and railroad the entire Trump crime family into the slammer   just where they belong.The GOP made a deal with the devil when their ignorant, bigoted voters chose this unfit orange overlord to be their presidential nominee.

 White House Panics Knowing Flynn Is Going To Take Them Down,"While Donald Trump has been taking vacations, special counsel Robert Mueller has been working hard on the Russia investigation. Instead of golfing this weekend, we suggest that the former reality show star huddle with his lawyers. Trump s former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador and he s fully cooperating with Mueller. As part of the plea deal, Flynn admitted that he was directed by a senior member of the Trump transition team to make contact with Russian officials in December. In addition, Flynn is prepared to testify that Trump as a candidate, ordered him to make contacts with the Russians.This marks the first instance of solid proof that there was collusion between team Trump and a hostile foreign government.On Friday, just after the news broke, the White House insisted that Flynn s guilty plea will not implicate Trump or anyone else in the White House.The White House said in a statement that Flynn was fired for making false statements to Trump officials, and that he worked for the administration for a short time   and that he was a former Obama administration official. The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year,  said White House lawyer Ty Cobb.  Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn. The White House then referred to Flynn as the  former National Security Advisor at the White House for 25 days  as well as  a former Obama administration official. However, the White House left out a few important details. President Obama fired Flynn as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and he also warned Trump about Flynn during a discussion two days after the election and emphasized that he had concerns about him joining the national security team for the new president.On top of that, just after Flynn was forced to resign, Trump called him a  wonderful man  who was treated unfairly by the media.Photo by David Becker/Getty Images.",News
 BREAKING: Michael Flynn CRACKS â€“ Will Testify To Mueller Against Trump Himself,"Michael Flynn, Trump s embattled former national security adviser, has reportedly caved in and will testify to Robert Mueller and his team about Trump s collusion with Russia. According to an ABC News special report, Flynn has pleaded guilty to charges that include making false statements to the FBI. Most importantly, he admitted in his plea that officials on Trump s transition team directed his contacts with Russian officials.Furthermore, according to CNN s David Wright on Twitter, there s more to it than that. He s reporting that Brian Ross, who reported for ABC News, said that Flynn also says he s prepared to testify that Trump himself  ordered him, directed him, to make contact with the Russians, which contradicts all that Donald Trump has said at this point. .@BrianRoss reports Michael Flynn  is prepared to testify that President Trump as a candidate   Donald Trump   ordered him, directed him, to make contacts with the Russians, which contradicts all that Donald Trump has said at this point.  David Wright (@DavidWright_CNN) December 1, 2017.@BrianRoss:  As well, we re told that Flynn made the decision to cooperate only in the last 24 hours. That he is distraught about this decision, but feels he is doing the right thing for his country     David Wright (@DavidWright_CNN) December 1, 2017.@BrianRoss:   and that he is facing huge legal bills of more than a million dollars, and he said that finally he had to go and do this for that reason. He expects to put his house on the market. He is facing serious financial problems.  David Wright (@DavidWright_CNN) December 1, 2017For his part, Flynn issued a statement saying the following: Actions I acknowledged in court today are wrong, and through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. My guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the Special Counsel s Office reflect a decision I made in the best interests of my family and of our country. I accept full responsibility for my actions. The White House has said that this is merely more of what got Flynn fired in the first place, and that this will have zero effect on Trump. Har de har har   don t make us laugh too hard. It hurts. Merry Christmas to Donald Trump and his entire treasonous family and administration!

 Trump Gets An Epic F**ck You From Britain Over His White Supremacist Retweets,"Donald Trump has a white supremacy problem, and now it is causing Great Britain, America s closest ally, to rebuke him in an historically public way. After Trump retweeted the leader of Britain First, a fascist white nationalist group, Prime Minister Theresa May decided she had had enough. She publicly criticized Trump, and made it clear that she in no way approved of his identifying with Britain First. May said of Trump s tweets: The fact that we work together does not mean that we re afraid to say when we think the United States has got it wrong, and be very clear with them. And I m very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do. May went on to call Britain First a  hateful organization  that has caused division in her nation. Now, it seems that a so-called  working visit  that had been planned soon for Trump in Britain will now be cancelled.Trump, of course, instead of trying to patch things up in the  special relationship  that has always existed between the United States and Great Britain, decided to attack the Prime Minister of our closest and most important ally   again, of course, via Twitter:.@Theresa_May, don t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2017Donald Trump is an absolute disgrace. He is shredding America s international relationships, and painting us as a country full of bigoted, knuckle-dragging morons in front of the entire world. No matter who cancelled the visit to the UK for Trump, they were right to do so. The UK s citizens are right to be outraged that this buffoon was set to come to their great nation. Now, if only we Americans could get rid of him in the same way. We can hope.Featured image via Thomas Lohnes/Getty Images",News
 This Hilarious Campaign Ad Shows Voters How They Can Avoid Scandalous Elected Officials,"In Michigan, the upcoming election in 2018 presents voters with an interesting option: They could, for the first time, have an all-female  ticket  for every major office being contested. Senator Debbie Stabenow is up for re-election, and odds are good that the nominees for Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary of State will all be women.At least one of those candidates thinks that s a very good thing. Democratic candidate for AG Dana Nessel has produced a campaign ad that capitalizes on the benefits of being female when it comes to running for public office. Namely, the fact that she doesn t have a d*ck to wave at every passerby.With the wave of allegations over the last few weeks, beginning with the outing of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein as a total pervert and a sexual predator, it seems like everywhere you look there s someone else being ousted from their position or job for having at least acted like a pig   and in some cases the allegations are even worse.Of course, not everyone is suffering from the paradigm shift that has stoked bravery in women across America and around the world. The highest office in the country is, of course, occupied by a man who s been accused by at least 19 women of everything from sexual harassment to actual inappropriate physical touching. And the open US Senate seat in Alabama is currently being contested by, on the Democratic side, the guy who successfully prosecuted the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham that killed four young black girls, and on the Republican side, a guy who s accused of pursuing, dating, and touching teenage girls as young as 14 when he was an Assistant District Attorney in his 30 s.Dana Nessel wants to help you avoid all of that unseemly contact with potentially predatory men by simply not being one: [W]hen you re choosing Michigan s next attorney general, ask yourself this: Who can you trust most not to show you their penis in a professional setting? Is it the candidate who doesn t have a penis? I d say so. Watch the amazing ad here:Featured image via Bill Pugliano/Getty Images",News
 Joe Scarborough: Itâ€™s Not Our Imagination â€“ Trump Really Is Losing His Mind (VIDEO),"People have long speculated about Donald Trump s mental state. While it was once seen as unseemly to suggest that a public figure may be crazy, Trump s alarming behavior warrants an exception   especially since he has the nuclear codes. Well, it s not our imagination   and that s not just because we can see with every wild statement and unhinged Twitter rant that something is wrong with Trump. It s because, according to former Republican Congressman and current host of MSNBC s Morning Joe reported on Thursday that several of Trump s allies confided to him that Trump has dementia.Then, Scarborough went all in, and called for the use of the 25th Amendment to remove Trump, and in doing so, decided to list many of Trump s infamous incidences of con artistry in the process: If this is not what the 25th Amendment was drafted for, I would like the Cabinet members serving America   not the president   you serve America, and you know it. You know you don t serve Donald J. Trump. Scam developer, scam Trump University proprietor, reality TV show host. You don t represent him. You represent 320 million people whose lives are literally in your hands, and we are facing a showdown with a nuclear power. You have somebody inside the White House that the New York Daily News says is mentally unfit. That people close to him say is mentally unfit, that people close to him during the campaign told me had early stages of dementia. This is astounding. Joe Scarborough is no liberal. I disagree with a lot of what he says, but he s definitely putting his country before his party, and doing the right thing. It s time for Republicans to stop being cowards and remove Trump.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News
 Sources Confirm Robert Muellerâ€™s Office Interviewed Jared Kushner Several Weeks Ago,"Jared Kushner, senior White House adviser and son-in-law of President Donald Trump, was interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller s office at the beginning of November, according to a source familiar with the process. As part of an interview that lasted approximately 90 minutes, Kushner was quizzed mainly on his interactions, meetings, and any general contact he had with former national security adviser Michael Flynn, as well as his son, in regards to Flynn s private business dealings with his firm, Flynn Intel Group. Mr. Kushner has voluntarily cooperated with all relevant inquiries and will continue to do so,  Kushner s attorney, Abbe Lowell, said in a statement given to NBC News.The news of Kushner s interview first came to light when grand jury testimony related to Flynn s private business dealings was postponed by prosecutors working for Mueller, the reason for which is still unclear. This postponement came just a week after Flynn s attorneys alerted President Trump s legal team that information related to the case could no longer be shared between the two parties, nor are they allowed to publicly comment on the matter. It is not uncommon for defense teams to share information, but the practice is considered unethical once a conflict of interest arises, not that Donald Trump has ever been particularly concerned with matters as trivial as  ethics. The fact that Flynn s attorneys are no longer sharing information with Trump s legal team is in no way proof that Flynn is cooperating with the special counsel, but it is a decent sign that he is working with them, but Trump s team has been expecting this for quite some time. It is probably a plea deal,  Jay Sekulow, a member of President Trump s legal team, told CBS News earlier in the month.  That is the assumption. And if it is a plea that doesn t necessarily mean it has anything to do with the president. The Manafort indictment didn t have anything to do with the campaign or Trump. Michael Flynn served as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency until he was fired from the position in 2014 by former President Barack Obama, however, he still retained a security clearance, even during Trump s presidential campaign and transition into the White House until Flynn s role was terminated 23 days into Trump s presidency. Any possible cooperation Flynn has with the prosecution could give Mueller s counsel insight into the Trump campaign s operations and potential dealings with Russia, as well as the first few weeks of his presidency.The FBI is already looking into both Flynn s Trump lobbying and Flynn Intel Group s research work for an unfinished film for which the firm was paid $530,000 by a Turkish businessman. Employees of Sphere Consulting, who did public relations work on the film, have been turning over documents requested by Mueller s investigators and sitting for voluntary interviews for several months.Featured image via Olivier Douliery   Pool/Getty Images",News
 Trump Sends Crazy-Time Tweet To The Wrong Account After Losing His Sh*t Over World Leaderâ€™s Remarks,"Donald Trump retweeted fake news videos in the early hours of the morning and for that, he was widely condemned. The White House responded to say that it doesn t matter if the former reality show star posted fake videos about Muslims because  the threat is real!  Scary, huh? A backlash ensued after Trump retweeted three times from a woman who was convicted of a hate crime in the U.K.The current occupant of the White House is upset because British Prime Minister Theresa May responded to Trump s widely condemned retweets this morning, saying,  It is wrong for the president to have done this.  In a statement, Downing street further said,  Britain First seeks to divide communities by their use of hateful narratives that peddle lies and stoke tensions. They cause anxiety to law-abiding people. Members of British Parliament also condemned Trump s retweets.So naturally, Trump lashed out on Twitter at our ally s leader.

 Americans Once Elected A President After He Was Accused Of Raping A 13-Year-Old Girl,"After an awful campaign filled with hateful rhetoric, American voters elected a man to lead the most powerful country on earth even after he was accused of raping a 13-year-old. The year was 2016 and the accused was an alleged billionaire, former reality show star and an admitted sexual predator. Still, even after the revelations, conservatives saw nothing wrong with Donald Trump s behavior. The plaintiff described the horrifying incident in which Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein allegedly raped a child. A lawsuit was filed which claims that threats were made in order for the victim to keep her mouth shut about what had just happened.Both Defendants let Plaintiff know that each was a very wealthy, powerful man and indicated that they had the power, ability, and means to carry out their threats. Indeed, Defendant Trump stated that Plaintiff shouldn t ever say anything if she didn t want to disappear like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that Plaintiff had not seen since that third incident, and that he was capable of having her whole family killed.There was a witness who backed up  Jane Doe s  claims. According to the lawsuit, Trump and Epstein  sexually and physically  abused the then 13-year-old plaintiff and forced her  to engage in various perverted and depraved sex acts    including being  forced to manually stimulate Defendant Trump with the use of her hand upon Defendant Trump s erect penis until he reached sexual orgasm,  and being  forced to engage in an unnatural lesbian sex act with her fellow minor and sex slave, Maria Doe, age 12, for the sexual enjoyment of Defendant Trump    after luring her to a  series of underage sex parties  by promising her  money and a modeling career,  according to Snopes.Trump has admitted knowing Epstein for 15 years. Epstein was named in multiple similar lawsuits, served 13 months in jail, and is registered as a sex offender for life.The lawsuit which was filed in California on April 26, 2016, was dismissed over technical filing errors and it was refiled in June of the same year, then dropped again in November after the plaintiff received death threats.Last year, Trump was also accused by 16 women of sexually harassing or assaulting them. Conservatives went on to elect him knowing full well that he is a sexual predator because he said so in the Access Hollywood tape.History will not be kind as it remembers November of 2016.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News
" Trumpâ€™s Biggest KKK Fan Is Back, And He Just LOVED Those Anti-Muslim Tweets This Morning","Just in case you needed any more proof that Donald Trump s racist tweets were a thinly-coded message to his alt-right, anti-Muslim, and white supremacist followers, a former Grand Wizard of the KKK has jumped on board today in praise of President Hates-a-Lot.It wasn t enough that the KKK endorsed Trump during his campaign to stop his multitudes of followers from voting for him, so it s hard to say whether Duke s full-throated endorsement of today s disgusting display of racism will be any different. But for the average American, seeing the former Klan leader get behind Trump so vigorously should make them more than a little sick.To even go to Duke s page on Twitter is to subject yourself to a blinding cover photo, all white, with a blue-eyed  Aryan  baby in the upper corner, and the words  It s Okay To Be White  across the middle. The phrase is part of a hate campaign that  Doctor  Duke has been pushing across America, a play on the notion that there is some kind of war on white people happening.But the tweet itself is disturbing:Trump retweets video of crippled white kid in Europe being beaten by migrants, and white people being thrown off a roof and then beaten to death, He's condemned for showing us what the fake news media WON'T. Thank God for Trump! That's why we love him!  David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) November 29, 2017By invoking God in his message, Duke is trying the age-old tactic of pretending that white supremacy has its roots in Christianity, an angle that KKK members have tried to use for generations.Sadly, it works on some followers of both Duke s and of Donald Trump s. It seems there s quite a bit of crossover between the two racist groups. That s no surprise: The KKK were absolutely instrumental in getting Trump elected.The bottom line is, both men know exactly what they re doing when they send messages like that to their followers. Trump s racist retweets were already disgraceful enough. But continuing to leave them on his Twitter feed even after seeing praise from a Loyal White Knight like David Duke is just rubbing salt in the wound.Featured image via William Thomas Cain/Getty Images",News

 Democrats Give Trump A Big F**ck You After He Attacks Them In Insane Twitter Rant,"Donald Trump s Twitter feed is always a goldmine of crazy. Unfortunately, since the orange overlord is now squatting in the Oval Office, those nutty tweets tend to have the ability to derail important policy initiatives, and can therefore have disastrous effects for the nation and sometimes the world. Case in point   the fact that he insisted upon attacking Democratic leaders that he had a meeting with regarding the debt ceiling, the Children s Health Insurance Program, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), and other important domestic policy initiatives. Apparently, Trump saw fit to take to Twitter to accuse his old pals  Chuck and Nancy  of not being strong enough on crime and immigration, and therefore doesn t see a way to make deals with them:Meeting with  Chuck and Nancy  today about keeping government open and working. Problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked, are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes. I don t see a deal!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2017Given this out-of-the-blue attack, Democratic Minority Leaders Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) released a joint statement promptly pulling out of the meeting, which reads: Given that the President doesn t see a deal between Democrats and the White House, we believe the best path forward is to continue negotiating with our Republican counterparts in Congress instead. Leader Pelosi then took to Twitter herself to take Trump on:Given that the President doesn t see a deal between Democrats and the White House, we believe the best path forward is to continue negotiating with our Republican counterparts in Congress instead.

 Trump Wakes Up To Scream At Black People After Hurling A Racial Slur Yesterday,"Donald Trump thinks if he rage-tweets about NFL players who choose to kneel instead of stand during the national anthem as a form of silent protest against racial injustice and police brutality, it will all go away but by doing that, he inadvertently highlights that there is a problem. The former reality show star dropped a racial slur yesterday in front of Native American heroes, then today, he jumped on Twitter to yell at black people. We see a pattern here. At least 24 players kneeling this weekend at NFL stadiums that are now having a very hard time filling up,  Trump screamed at the world.  The American public is fed up with the disrespect the NFL is paying to our Country, our Flag and our National Anthem. Weak and out of control!

If he wants to talk about attendance, we can discuss his unenthusiastic inauguration crowd size. As for his ratings, he ranks as the least popular president in the history of polling.Donald Trump is actively trying to divide our country even more than it already is.

 Trump Supporters Object To Prince Harryâ€™s Recent Engagement For Terrible Reasons (TWEETS),"Great Britain s Buckingham Palace announced yesterday that Prince Harry, the youngest son of Diana, Princess of Wales, had gotten engaged. A royal engagement is always big news in the United Kingdom, but this one also hit home in the United States too, because Harry s now-fiance is American actress Meghan Markle, best known for her roles as Rachel Zane in the legal drama series Suits, as well as special agent Amy Jessup in the sci-fi thriller Fringe.The British royal family no longer holds anywhere near as much clout as it once did, now essentially relegated to mere tabloid fodder, but while many were expressing their happiness online for one of the Windsor s most beloved members, quite a few Trump supporters expressed their dissatisfaction at the prince s choice. You see, Markle is biracial, her father being Caucasian and her mother African-American, and in the minds of many deplorables, this is a bad thing.It s completely irrelevant that Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh and husband of the reigning Queen Elizabeth II, is half-Greek, because that is pretty much white. However, when news broke of Prince Harry s engagement to Markle, white supremacists from across the United States and around the globe took to Twitter, because in their twisted minds, disturbing the racial purity of the British royal family is not a good thing, despite the fact the fact it has been going on for centuries. Here is but a mere sample:It's all smiles on TV but in private the #QUEEN is figuring out how to stop #PrinceHarry from destroying the #royalbloodline with mixed race #royalwedding #godsavethequeen $fb $twtr $goog #MAGA  $PENNY KING (@groman100) November 27, 2017Totally unsuitable as a Royal bride.

That s right, Prince Harry has made it quite clear that President Donald Trump is not welcome at his wedding, despite the bride being a United States citizen. Barack and Michelle Obama, on the other hand, will more than likely be welcomed with open arms.Both Harry and especially his mother, Princess Diana, are well-known for their humanitarian work and according to a close source, the prince is  not a fan  of Trump.  Harry thinks the president is a serious threat to human rights,  the source continued, but there might be a lot more to it than just that.When Princess Diana split from her husband, Prince Charles, in 1992, a palace aide claims that Trump was  relentless  in his pursuit of Diana, a claim backed up by British TV journalist and friend of the princess, Selina Scott. Scott said that Trump bombarded Diana at Kensington Palace with massive bouquets of flowers,  adding that he gave Diana  the creeps,  a fact Trump representatives obviously deny. Then there were these tweets from Donald Trump when Princess Kate Middleton, wife of Harry s brother, Prince William, was illegally photographed by paparazzi sunbathing topless in her backyard in 2012:Kate Middleton is great but she shouldn't be sunbathing in the nude only herself to blame.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2012Who wouldn't take Kate's picture and make lots of money if she does the nude sunbathing thing. Come on Kate!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2012Meghan Markle has also been a critic of the President, calling him misogynistic  and once even threatened to leave the US if he became president, so she would most likely be fine with Trump s non-attendance at her wedding, but his supporters won t take too kindly to him being shunned.Featured image via Chris Jackson/Getty Images for the Invictus Games Foundation",News
" While Honoring Native American Code Talkers, Trump Called Elizabeth Warren â€˜Pocahontasâ€™ (VIDEO)","Former reality show star Donald Trump just can t stop using a slur to describe Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) but this time he took things to the edge then crossed the line.

Trump was literally surrounded by Native Americans when he hurled the slur. The chief. He s the general and the chief,  Trump said during the White House event, in reference to White House chief of staff John Kelly.  I said, how good were these code talkers? He said, sir, you have no idea. You have no idea how great they were, what they have done for this country and the strength and the bravery and the love for the country. So that was the ultimate statement from General Kelly, the importance,  Trump continued.  And I just want to thank you because you re very, very special people.

 Pro-Trump Group Is Now Using Pictures Of An Obama Rally To Make Trump Look Popular,"In their pathetic attempt to pass the deeply unpopular and unfair tax bill that Republicans in Congress have been working on, the GOP has pulled out all the stops   and so have outside spending groups.Every campaign season, America is inundated with ad after ad claiming that one candidate or the other will be either the nation s savior or its downfall. But when ads start popping up for legislation, you know the party that s pushing it is desperate for support.America First Policies, a pro-Trump organization that calls itself a non-profit just because they legally can, has come up with a new ad intended to convince Americans to call their members of Congress and demand that they vote yes on the upcoming tax nightmare. We know it s a nightmare because the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office just scored the bill on Sunday night, and said that the legislation, which has had ZERO hearings, raises taxes on the poor, cuts taxes on the rich, and cripples Obamacare by repealing the individual mandate that makes the system function.The ad is a clever bit of doublespeak itself, as is everything that Republicans say when it comes to taxes. They have promoted the utterly debunked theory of  trickle-down  economics for more than three decades, and for all of their posturing, not a single dime of tax cuts for corporations and the super-wealthy has ever  trickled down  in the form of economic stimulus or higher pay for workers   as they perennially promise that it will.But it s an image that AFP uses in the ad that s catching people s attention.Watch the ad and see if you catch something that looks familiar:Check out our NEW TV ADThis is our once in a generation opportunity to CUT TAXES for the Middle Class.

 Breitbart Editor To CNN Host: A Song By Ringo Starr Proves Roy Moore Isnâ€™t A Pedo (VIDEO),"A Breitbart News editor tried to use a song Ringo Starr covered in order to make claims appear to be false that controversial Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with teenage girls when he was in his thirties. On Monday, Breitbart editor Joel Pollak told host Chris Cuomo on CNN s  New Day  that Starr released  You re Sixteen (You re Beautiful, You re Mine),  a cover of a song that was actually written by Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman and performed by Johnny Burnette. The song was also featured in  American Graffiti. He was 30-something at the time singing about a 16-year-old,  Pollak said.  You want to take away Ringo Starr s achievement? You can t be serious,  Cuomo shot back.  I m dead serious. You think that Ringo Starr s song is supposed to be a nod toward allowing 30-year-olds to prey on teenagers? You don t believe that, Joel. You re a parent. You don t believe that.

He said it wasn t  accurate  to claim that the teenage girls were teenagers because one of them was 16 and the other was 18, both of which would be considered   wait for it   teenage years.Moore, by the way, has been accused of pursuing relationships with girls as young as 14-years-old when he was in his 30s. Moore was also banned from the Gadsden Mall and the YMCA for perving on teenage girls. A police officer was assigned to the job of making sure Moore stayed away from high school ballgames to be sure he didn t bother the cheerleaders.Someone should check Pollak s browsing history. Just a thought. In fact, check Donald Trump s, too, since he s come out strong in support of Roy Moore.Image via screen capture. ",News
 Former Obama Photographer Takes Trolling Trump To A Whole New Level (TWEETS),"By now you would most likely be familiar with the story of President Trump taking a pass at being named Time Magazine s Person of the Year, a rather prestigious honor that Trump has a bizarre fixation with and one that is highly unlikely to be bestowed upon him again any time in the near future following his nomination last year.For those of you not in the know, Donald Trump tried to claim on Friday that he turned down the chance to be selected as Time s  Person of the Year,  as he would be required to give an interview and do a photo shoot. Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named  Man (Person) of the Year,  like last year, but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot.

" Two Weeks Before Election, Trump Still Defends Accused Child Molester Because TAXES, Yâ€™all","Sunday morning, after what must have seemed like another interminable weekend of scrutiny, terror, and being made to look like a fool, Donald Trump returned to doing what he does best: Being an absolute garbage person. He was still recovering from the humiliation of his hilariously bad attempt at pretending TIME Magazine  offered  him their Person of the Year honorific, followed by the embarrassment of trying to troll CNN, only to see their response tweet get twice the likes and retweets of his original.So Trump had to up his game. And how could he possibly piss off more people than by pivoting back to Roy Moore, the accused pedophile running for the US Senate in Alabama?Even some of Trump s most ardent supporters have begged the Doddering Dotard to back off his support for the toxic candidate. It s hard, as you might imagine, to truly get behind a guy who s accused of molesting young girls, especially with so much evidence against him. But Trump tried nonetheless:The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is WEAK on Crime, WEAK on the Border, Bad for our Military and our great Vets, Bad for our 2nd Amendment, AND WANTS TO RAISES TAXES TO THE SKY. Jones would be a disaster!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 26, 2017I endorsed Luther Strange in the Alabama Primary. He shot way up in the polls but it wasn t enough. Can t let Schumer/Pelosi win this race. Liberal Jones would be BAD!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 26, 2017It s an interesting tack to take   just talking about how terrible Doug Jones is, rather than addressing the fact that Roy Moore is accused of touching children inappropriately. What s more interesting is how wrong he is on every count. Weak on crime? Jones successfully prosecuted the KKK members who blew up a Birmingham church, killing four young black girls in 1963. The Second Amendment? The most Jones supports as far as gun control is expanded background checks. Bad for the military? Jones supports increased military spending, a position that puts him at odds with the two lawmakers that Trump tries to  tie  Jones to in his tweets. Jones is largely considered a moderate among Democrats.The bottom line is, Trump is terrified of losing a crucial vote on his signature tax cuts for the wealthy. He is so calculating that if he didn t have something so important pending, he would throw Roy Moore under the bus in a heartbeat   despite the similarities between accusations against Moore and accusations against himself.This is the worst of politics, people. And when the Republican Party is bloodied on the floor of America, they can thank their garbage president who refused to back away from a child molester just because he wants to  accomplish  something before he s booted out of office.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News
 Principles Over Power: Why Republicans Need To Do Whatâ€™s Right To Remain Relevant,"Over the last few weeks, I ve watched as the last shreds of the Republican Party s  family values  rotted away.As Alabama voters prepare to go to the polls in December they have two choices before them.They can vote for the Democrat and prove that they refuse to tolerate an accused child molester and sexual predator being in their party and in the Senate, or they can put political power over the morality they have long preached about.In other words, they can either put power over principles or put principles over power.They can t do both.And while they are damned if they do and damned if they don t, choosing the latter of those two options would be a far better and more honorable choice.Some things go above politics, and sexual assault is, and rightfully should, be one of them.Voting for Moore for the sake of political power throws every sexual assault victim under the bus. It will especially be a slap in the face of women across the country, a major voting block that has already been overwhelmingly voting Democrat for many years.If Republicans want to have any chance of surviving as a legitimate political party for many more decades to come, it is critical that they start by drawing a line in the sand when it comes to Moore and the people who defend him such as Donald Trump.This starting point alone can restore a little of the respect the GOP has lost. Perhaps then, they ll even be courageous enough to rejects the racists and the sexists and the Nazis, which will do more to grow the ranks of the party than the Southern Strategy ever did.And then the Republican Party can get past being a haven for extremists and anti-government zealots and get on the road to becoming a sane party with real ideas instead of simply opposing and obstructing at every turn, which has not been good for the country at all.America has lost its respect of the international community and our reputation has been seriously sullied. Letting Moore step inside the Senate would send a message to the world that America supports child molestation and the sexual assault and harassment of women.Such a message from the Republican Party smacks of hypocrisy. After all, we are talking about the same party that constantly bring up the sexual assault allegations against Bill Clinton.But just like how they constantly bring up Abraham Lincoln in an attempt to claim that the Republican Party must still be great, their rhetoric about Bill Clinton is old and tired and not really that relevant today. The GOP is far removed from the days of Lincoln. And Bill Clinton was president two decades ago and if he were running today he would not win. The sexual assault allegations alone would prevent him from even getting on the ballot.However, by supporting Donald Trump, who was accused by a dozen women of sexual assault during the 2016 campaign, Republicans committed a serious hypocrisy that undermines their Bill Clinton talking point.If Moore wins next month, Republicans will only be doubling down on that hypocrisy and they ll be past the point of no return. And the consequences will be severe.America is more diverse than ever before. Women have emerged as a force to be reckoned with after decades of old white guys running the show. Minorities are also set to become the majority of the population, and once that scale tips, the GOP will no longer be able to be the party of white people. It just won t work.It s just a matter of time, and time is running out for the Republican Party.And that s why they must rise above politics and stand for something bigger than themselves.Sexual assault and child molestation should not be rewarded with power and prestige. And that should go beyond the political arena as well, whether the behavior is coming from a corporate CEO or the part-owner of a website or a church leader or any other position of power.Republicans need to start practicing the  morality  they preach and they can do that by putting politics aside and do the right thing.That s what Republicans did in 1860 when they voted for a dark horse candidate as their flagbearer. Lincoln then put politics aside to assemble one of the greatest Cabinets in our history, bringing together liberal and conservative Republicans and even a Democrat or two.And even though Lincoln remained neutral at first and the politics of day made it really difficult, he made the decision to put politics aside and pushed for the passage of the 13th Amendment. Such a move at the time could have cost Lincoln a second term, but he did it anyway.Lincoln put principle over power in the face of an even more contentious and hateful political environment than we are experiencing today. It s time for Republicans to do the same now.Seven years ago, my first article for this site explained how Republicans have put power over principles for decades to the detriment of our progress towards a better future for everyone.Today, I want inform my loyal readers that this will be my final article for Addicting Info.It has been an honor and a privilege to write here for so many years.

For example, the infamous Access Hollywood tape in which he suggests that because he s powerful, he can just grab women by their p-ssies. Trump defended sexual harasser and Fox News host (yeah, I know that s redundant) Bill O Reilly in the recent past and even more recently, he has defended alleged pedophile and Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. So, defending perverts is just another day for Donald Trump.Here s a quick reminder of what Trump said on the p*ssy grabbing tape: You know I m automatically attracted to beautiful [women]   I just start kissing them. It s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don t even wait. And when you re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything. The New York Times reports that even after Trump made an almost-apology after the tape was revealed, he still told a Senator and an adviser that the Access Hollywood tape may not be authentic.But something deeper has been consuming Mr. Trump. He sees the calls for Mr. Moore to step aside as a version of the response to the now-famous  Access Hollywood  tape, in which he boasted about grabbing women s genitalia, and the flood of groping accusations against him that followed soon after. He suggested to a senator earlier this year that it was not authentic, and repeated that claim to an adviser more recently.So, to reiterate, Trump told an adviser recently that the video and tape of him talking about perving on women is fake news. And he also told that to a Senator after it was released.We see a pattern here. Maybe Trump s cult-like following will believe this crap but the rest of us remember that tape all too well. That tape was an indicating factor that Donald J. Trump is unfit for office, morally and intellectually.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News
 CNN BLISTERS Trump After He Attacks Them For Bad Representation: â€˜Thatâ€™s Your Jobâ€™ (TWEETS),"One of Donald Trump s favorite punching bags is CNN. He even once tweeted a GIF image of himself punching a person with a CNN logo superimposed over the head   indicating that he d like to enact violence against CNN s reporters. Then there was the time he tweeted the  Trump Train  roaring over  CNN.  Now, he s back at it   this time suggesting that  fake  CNN should be the ones representing America to the world, and that they are doing a bad job. Here is that tweet:.@FoxNews is MUCH more important in the United States than CNN, but outside of the U.S., CNN International is still a major source of (Fake) news, and they represent our Nation to the WORLD very poorly. The outside world does not see the truth from them!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 25, 2017Of course, it is beneath the dignity of most people to respond to a moronic buffoon like Trump under normal circumstances. However, he is currently squatting in the White House, and has his tiny orange hands on the levers of power   not to mention the nuclear codes   so they have to stoop to a Trumpian level when personally attacked. However, being, well, you know, FIT to be doing the job they are doing, the good folks at CNN Communications fired back at Trump, and their response is nothing short of perfect:It's not CNN's job to represent the U.S to the world. That's yours. Our job is to report the news. #FactsFirst   CNN Communications (@CNNPR) November 25, 2017BOOM! Couldn t have asked for a sicker burn than this. And they are right of course   especially the part about #FactsFirst. Trump has a problem with the truth, as we all well know. That s what makes what the CNN Communications people replied so fabulous. It is the ultimate truth   something the likes of the pathological orange liar that is Donald Trump knows nothing about.Featured image via  Andrew Burton/Getty Images",News

" Gay GOP Operative Endorses Doug Jones Over â€˜Bigoted, Deviantâ€™ Roy Moore In Senate Race (VIDEO)","The Republican Party has a Roy Moore problem. Even before it came out that the judge turned Alabama Senate candidate is accused of being a child molester, he was a problem. He had been removed twice from the Alabama Supreme Court for flagrantly defying the law. Moore has said Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress. He waved a gun around on stage at a campaign rally and rode a horse to the polls in Alabama to vote for himself in the primary he would eventually win against establishment-backed interim Senator Luther Strange. Well, it seems that with all of this and then some, sane Republicans have had enough of Roy Moore. One such person is former Jeb Bush campaign strategist Tim Miller. He  has a solution to his party s Roy Moore problem: Vote for the Democrat, Doug Jones, to keep Roy Moore the hell away from the United States Senate.Miller happens to be gay, so of course Moore s disgusting homophobia is a problem for him. Then there is, of course, the child molesting. In a column for the left-wing site Crooked Media entitled  The Republican Case for Doug Jones,  Miller says of his decision, which he calls,  obvious : But here we are in the dark abyss of 2017, and in this political moment, child exploitation attempted child rape, even has become a partisan issue. President Donald Trump is even cool with it, as long as the sex predator is on his team. A comrade in genital grabbing if you will. So after Trump essentially re-endorsed Alabama s Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, this particular child predator, on Tuesday, I took what I thought was an obvious step. I donated to the other guy s campaign. But in this instance there was one wrinkle for me. The other guy, Doug Jones, is a Democrat. And I a Republican political operative have never donated to one of those before. Thus, in sharing the fact that I had made the donation on social media, I also noted that this was a first for me, even though it felt extremely obvious. Here is the tweet where Tim Miller announces his crossover:I just donated to a Democrat for the first time in my life if any of yall want to do so as well. Enough is enough. https://t.co/YlDXTXSnyJ  Tim Miller (@Timodc) November 21, 2017Tim Miller is right. Roy Moore is absolutely deplorable, and should be nowhere near the United States Senate. This isn t politics, it s morals. Now, it is time for more sane, reasonable Republicans to get out there and do the unthinkable   reject a child molester and endorse and donate to the man who prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan while Roy Moore was busy creeping on little girls. It s not that hard.Watch the video of Tim Miller s appearance on The Last Word with Lawrence O Donnell below:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News
 WATCH: Retired Alabama Cop: We Were Told To Keep Roy Moore Away From High School Cheerleaders,"It seems that Republican candidate for Attorney General Jeff Sessions  vacated Senate seat Roy Moore s proclivity for teenage girls was well known decades ago in Gadsden, Alabama   even within the courthouse where he worked as an Assistant District Attorney, and even within the police department. Retired police officer Faye Gary spoke with MSNBC and said of the situation: The rumor mill was that he liked young girls, and   we were advised that he was being suspended from the mall because he would hang around the young girls that worked in the stores and   really got into a place of where they say he was harassing. We were also told to watch him at the ball games, and make sure that   he didn t hang around the cheerleaders. Faye Gary went on to say that she originally thought that Moore liked, perhaps, women in their 20 s   you know, LEGAL younger women. But, no. It was actually teenagers the old creep liked. Gary also said that Moore s liking for little girls   was a known fact,  while speaking with the New York Times, going on to say,  It was treated like a joke. That s just the way it was. Of course, Roy Moore has long been a controversial character. He was removed from the Alabama Supreme Court twice, both times refusing to follow the law. The first time it was over his refusal to removed a 5,000+ pound monument of the Ten Commandments from the Supreme Court building, and the second time for ordering officials around the state to refuse to comply with the United States Supreme Court s ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which legalized marriage equality nation wide. He has also said that Representative Keith Ellison should not be allowed to serve in Congress because he is a Muslim. In other words, this is a man who has no regard for the rule of law, and is likely a child molester to boot.In short, the voters of Alabama need to reject this bigoted extremist, and, if they don t, they ll be sending a message to the rest of the nation: a child molester is much better to be seated in the Senate than a Democrat.Watch Faye Gary s comments on the matter below:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News
 New York Times Reports Thereâ€™s An Actual Russian Agent In Congress And He Has A Code Name,"More than a year ago, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy was caught *oops* on a hot mic saying that there were two people in Washington who were being paid by the Russians   Donald Trump and California GOP. Rep Dana Rohrabacher. Sadly, those two people are still in office.A new report by the New York Times, though, confirms half of McCarthy s comments. Rohrabacher isn t just being paid by the Russians, he s a Russian agent, and he has a code name, and it s not even new information.According to the Times report, the FBI warned Rohrbacher in 2012 that the Russians viewed him as a source and had given him a code name. The next year, Congress elevated him to the chairmanship of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee that overseas Russian policy. Nope, nothing at all fishy there.Rohrabacher didn t seem to have much involvement in the Trump campaign (that would be too obvious, even for the Russians), but Special Investigator Robert Mueller is eyeing him nonetheless:As revelations of Russia s campaign to influence American politics consume Washington, Mr. Rohrabacher, 70, who had no known role in the Trump election campaign, has come under political and investigative scrutiny. The F.B.I. and the Senate Intelligence Committee are each seeking to interview him about an August meeting with Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, Mr. Rohrabacher said. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is said to be interested in a meeting he had last year with Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump s short-lived national security adviser.Rohrabacher s Russian connections go back further than just a few years, though. As a young Reaganite, he got the warm fuzzies with the fall of the Soviet Union and he developed a relationship with Vladimir Putin. In the 90s, Rohrabacher lost an arm wrestling match to the man who would become President for life, or whatever the hell Putin calls himself.Rohrabacher, naturally, denies that he is a Russian agent:Mr. Rohrabacher has laughed off suggestions that he is a Russian asset, and said in an interview that he did not remember being briefed that the Russians viewed him as a source. The F.B.I. and the senior members of the House Intelligence Committee sat Mr. Rohrabacher down in the Capitol in 2012 to warn him that Russian spies were trying to recruit him, according to two former intelligence officials. I remember them telling me,  You have been targeted to be recruited as an agent,  he said.  How stupid is that? Only, his actions paint a very different picture. In 2016, he served as what might be called a delivery boy between Russia and either the Trump campaign or the RNC. He picked up a memo targeting Democratic donors. Rohrabacher has also met with Wikileaks  Julian Assange and Russian (accused criminal) oligarchs.Rohrabacher insists nothing untoward is going on. His goal, he says, is to bring Russia in to help us battle terrorism. To be fair, Russia could help rein in terrorism, but they would have to stop funding terrorists, like Syrian President Bashir Assad.Republicans are finding it a bit easier to distance themselves from Rohrabacher than the other alleged Russian agent, Donald Trump. They are limiting his power on the Foreign Affairs committee.Politically, this could be disaster for Rohrabacher. He s facing a tough race in California, and you d better believe that his opponents are using his Russian connections against him.Hans Keirstead, a prominent stem-cell researcher competing with five other Democrats to challenge Mr. Rohrabacher, compared the Republican s Russia record to  a prologue to a very bad book. We ve got a Russian-tainted congressman,  Mr. Keirstead said in an interview, adding  Why should the constituents of the 48th District vote for an individual whose interests are elsewhere? Of course, Rohrabacher, like anyone who s been trained in dictator 101, is fundraising off of it, calling it an  attack. Featured image via Adam Berry/Getty Images.",News
 Fox News Bans Gene Simmons For Life For Harassing Staff Off Camera,"Gene Simmons, the 68-year-old Kiss bassist and co-lead singer, contestant on The Celebrity Apprentice for a grand total of three episodes back in 2008, self-proclaimed womanizer, and all-around poster-boy for washed up, aging rock stars who will stop at nothing to keep their names in the rapidly-diminishing spotlight, has stooped to a new low in his battle against irrelevancy   He has been given a lifetime ban from Fox News.When it comes to Fox News, the network has a tendency to be a little lenient on the issue of behavior of sexual nature, a reputation that screams  Hold my beer!  to a man like Gene Simmons. On what was far from his first appearance on the network, Simmons was a guest last Wednesday on Fox and Friends, as well as Fox Business Network s Mornings With Maria, to promote his new book, On Power. Gene Simmons, who claims to know Donald Trump  very well  and that the current President s critics should  get over it,  couldn t be faulted for his onscreen appearance, even helping with the weather report:MUST SEE: @genesimmons helps @JaniceDean with the weather! pic.twitter.com/EFfRQESNuq  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) November 15, 2017Simmons also sat on a panel with Mornings With Maria host Maria Bartiromo and gave his view on the Harvey Weinstein sexual-misconduct case. The lunatics have taken over the insane asylum when respected business entities such as yourself ask guys that like to stick their tongues out what I think of Harvey Weinstein,  Simmons answered.  Okay, I m a powerful and attractive man, and what I m about to say is deadly serious,  he added.  Men are jackasses. From the time we re young we have testosterone. I m not validating it or defending it. As is always the case, however, it was when the cameras weren t rolling that things began to get creepy and also quite hypocritical. According to a knowledgeable Fox News source, Simmons arrived on the studio s fourteenth floor to do an interview with FoxNews.com s entertainment section to promote his book, but also chose to walk into a staff meeting uninvited, opened his shirt and shouted,  Hey chicks, sue me! He didn t stop there, though. The source claims he went on to tell pedophilia-related Michael Jackson jokes, hit two employees on the head with his book while making comparisons on their intelligence based on the sounds, and asked an African-American employee if he was Al Roker.  It was pretty severe,  the source said.Simmons  behavior was reported to a supervisor, who in turn passed the news on to Fox News human-resources executive Kevin Lord, who promptly banned Simmons from the building. He was also permanently barred from appearing on any Fox News or Fox Business Networkprogramming.It seems that Gene Simmons may have had a change of heart over the past week, as he has released the following statement: I have appeared frequently over the years on various Fox News and Fox Business programs and have a tremendous amount of respect for the talented women and men who work there. While I believe that what is being reported is highly exaggerated and misleading, I am sincerely sorry that I unintentionally offended members of the Fox team during my visit. Although Simmons  interview with FoxNews.com was recorded, it will not be released.Featured image via Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images",News
 WATCH: Nicolle Wallace Takes Trump To The Woodshed For Backing Pedophile Moore,"Donald Trump just got his ass handed to him by Nicolle Wallace for endorsing an accused child molester.Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore has been accused of sexual assault by several women, most of whom were teens at the time. One woman was 14-years-old.Age of consent laws apparently did not matter to Moore, who was the district attorney during the time period in which most of the assaults allegedly occurred. Moore own former colleagues have confirmed that Moore preyed upon teenage girls and he was even banned from a shopping mall because he kept creeping on teen girls.On Tuesday, Trump finally spoke out about Moore and the allegations. And what he said was sickening.Trump accused Moore s opponent Doug Jones of being  soft  on crime before saying he d rather have an accused child molester in the Senate instead of a Democrat. Then he defended Moore the same way he defended Vladimir Putin during his trip to Asia. Well, he denies it, Trump said.  Look, he denies it. I mean, if you look at all the things that have happened over the last 48 hours, he totally denies it. He says it didn t happen and you know, you have to listen to him also. Trump s words were so disgusting that MSNBC s Nicolle Wallace took him to the woodshed. I have this physical feeling of just being repulsed listening to   be it a figure head, he is the head of the Republican Party and I have described myself as a nonpracticing member, but I don t know what other word to use other than repulsed, that the head of the Republican Party said essentially threw his weight behind someone accused of stalking and engaging in sexual activity with a 14-year-old. There s nothing normal about throwing your weight behind a child molester. So when he says, this president says  he denies it, he denies it  I almost heard in him,  I denied it too.  He s almost projecting on to Roy Moore his own circumstance. Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, Trump was accused of sexual assault by over a dozen women during the campaign. He called all of them liars at the time. And it looks like that s coming back to bite Trump on the ass.Featured Image: Screenshot",News
 Pastor Goes Full Yâ€™all Qaeda Defending Roy Moore: He Only Wanted Teen Girls For Their â€˜Purityâ€™,"A pastor who appeared alongside Senate candidate Roy Moore at a campaign rally just days ago just gave a defense of the Alabama Senate candidate that makes Christian purity balls seem even creepier. Flip Benham has quite a history as an anti-gay pastor who was also convicted of stalking a doctor who performed abortion procedures in North Carolina. In reaction to that in 2011, Benham said outside the courtroom while holding a Bible, I can t speak. I can t get within 500 feet. They ve stolen from innocent babies a voice that has spoken for them. Well, that whole pro-life platform of his sure did change since then and his defense of Roy Moore, the twice-removed judge who has been accused of perving on teenage girls when he was 32-years-old, is not going to help the Alabama Republican.The right-wing pastor explained that Moore dated teen girls because of their  purity  and said that when he got back from Vietnam there weren t any women his age left to date.So, pedophilia, right?On Monday, Benham told a local Alabama radio show that there was nothing wrong with Moore dating teenage girls. I think that, number one, you need to understand, 40 years ago, what the Sitz im Leben was like in Alabama,  Benham said, as reported by Right Wing Watch.  Judge Roy Moore graduated from West Point and then went on into the service, served in Vietnam and then came back and was in law school.

 Trumpâ€™s National Security Adviser Reportedly TRASHED Him â€“ This Is Epic,"Add Trump s national security adviser, General H.R. McMaster, to the growing list of high-profile people who think he s a total buffoon. McMaster, a seasoned combat officer in the Army, is reportedly fed up with Trump s lack of intelligence, lack of focus, and inability to understand even the most basic premises of national security.According to several Buzzfeed sources, McMaster was attending a private dinner with Oracle CEO Safra Catz, and dragged Trump through the mud, calling him an  idiot,  a  dope,  and someone with the intelligence of  a kindergartner.  Another source who wasn t at the dinner told Buzzfeed that McMaster has made similar comments before.Recently, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly called Trump a moron, prompting the man-baby to jump on Twitter and challenge Tillerson to an IQ test. Trump either knows exactly what he is and is riddled with self-loathing and embarrassment over it, or he honestly believes he has one of the great minds and memories of all time, just like he s claimed, and his fragile fee-fees can t handle anyone thinking otherwise.Then there s Senator Bob Corker, who s had no qualms at all about criticizing Trump, which led the two of them into a Twitter war because Trump can t stand looking like the pathetic, ineffective pseudo-man that he is. And we all know how Senator Jeff Flake feels.Officials who are on Trump s side, however, push back against all these things vehemently. From their stories, everything is hunky-dory in the White House, and Trump is highly competent, calm, collected, respected   in short, presidential. Anyone inside or outside the White House talking badly about him is just, well, jealous ? Or un-American ? To them, these stories are nothing more than people deliberately working to undermine Trump, at least in the world Trump and his loyalists are desperate to create.These stories keep coming out, though, and when taken with his embarrassing public appearances and his ridiculous behavior on Twitter, they are ever harder to ignore. Buzzfeed has five sources for McMaster s words, with a sixth saying they d heard similar words from him before.This dinner between McMaster and Catz took place over the summer, and was allegedly peppered with insults toward Trump and other senior members of the White House staff, including Trump s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. McMaster reportedly (and, if true, correctly) said that Kushner doesn t belong in the White House and shouldn t be involved in national security matters.In short, Trump doesn t have the respect he thinks he has.

 Trumpâ€™s Favorite News Channel Tries To Soothe His Battered Ego â€“ Gets Taken To The Cleaners,"Yesterday, after the father of one of the UCLA players arrested in China failed to show Trump proper gratitude for getting his kid released, Trump, predictably, went to Twitter to grouse about it. He seems to expect to be worshiped for his help on this matter, but LaVar Ball wouldn t do it, so Trump tweeted:Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!  Donald J.

 Texas Governor Just Broke With Trump; This Is Unprecedented,"Republicans in Texas, including Gov. Greg Abbott, ripped into the new $44 billion White House disaster relief aid request as  inadequate.  It s been two months since the state was devastated by Hurricane Harvey and Donald Trump has failed on his promise to rebuild Texas. Abbott s criticism is strikingly different than the day after Trump visited Texas in the aftermath of the hurricane. His commitment was firm, strong and unequivocal,  Abbott said at the time.  That he was going to do everything he could to ensure that Texas will be restored as swiftly, as effectively as possible. But now, two months later, Republicans are calling the response  wholly inadequate,  according to the Dallas News.The White House disaster relief aid request falls well short of the demands made by officials from Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico.Greg Abbott said that the request  does not live up  to what Trump pledged in recovery aid. Abbott noted during a news conference that he s still reviewing the White House request but that it appears to be  completely inadequate.  What s more, Abbott said, it  does not live up  to what Trump has pledged in recovery aid, then he said that Washington worked faster for victims of Superstorm Sandy than for Harvey. Superstorm Sandy hit in 2012 during the Obama administration, by the way. The president has told me privately what he said publicly, and that is he wants to be the builder president. The president has said he wants this to be the best recovery from a disaster ever,  Abbott said.It s not just Abbott. Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican, blasted the request as  wholly inadequate.  A chorus of Texas lawmakers slammed it as insufficient.Houston Rep. John Culberson, a Republican and appropriations committee member, ripped Trump s recovery efforts, calling the request a  complete lack of understanding of the fundamental needs of Texans  and said it is a  nightmare  for Harvey survivors.Democrats, too, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, are criticizing the measure as measly.If only someone has warned Abbott and his Republican colleagues to not trust Trump, then maybe they wouldn t be so shocked. Maybe we would have a different leader who has the ability to deal with critical issues. Wait, they were warned, weren t they?Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News
 Conservative â€˜Christianâ€™ Leader Kept A Sexual Assault Secret For A Republican Lawmaker,"Conservatives should shun Tony Perkins for this.Earlier this week, Ohio GOP state Rep. Wes Goodman was busted for carrying on a same-sex affair in his taxpayer funded office, forcing him to tender his resignation.But there is an even worse transgression in Goodman s past, one that should drag the Family Research Council leader to hell with him.As it turns out, Goodman once fondled an 18-year-old without consent in his hotel room at the Ritz Carlton in Washington D.C.The teen s stepfather was quick to alert Perkins of the incident via email, warning him that continuing to endorse Goodman would be a mistake. If we endorse these types of individuals, then it would seem our whole weekend together was nothing more than a charade,  the teen s stepfather wrote. Trust me,  Perkins replied.  This will not be ignored nor swept aside. It will be dealt with swiftly, but with prudence. Perkins withdrew his support and suspended Goodman from the Council for National Policy. Going forward so soon, without some distance from your past behavior and a track record of recovery, carries great risk for you and for those who are supporting you,  Perkins wrote to Goodman.But Perkins failed to report the crime to law enforcement. Instead, he kept quiet and allowed a sexual predator to gain public office. In fact, even the board members of the Council for National Policy knew about the crime because Perkins informed them, and none of them did a damn thing about it.And this all happened just two years ago in 2015. Surely, Perkins and the board members he told can still be prosecuted for failing to report Goodman to the authorities.Because they definitely should be.Featured Image: Wikimedia",News
 GOP Senator Caught On Hot Mic Trashing His Own Party Over Roy Moore And Donald Trump (VIDEO)," Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) is liberated now that he has announced his retirement. In his resignation speech on the Senate floor, Flake issued a scathing takedown of Trump, and it seems his views have not changed. At a town hall on tax reform, Flake was caught on a hot mic while he was chatting with the mayor of Mesa, Arizona, fellow Republican John Giles. Flake said of extremist candidates and officials like Alabama Senate candidate and alleged pedophile Roy Moore, and the current  president  Donald Trump: If we become the party of Roy Moore and Donald Trump, we are toast. Giles responded: And I am not throwing smoke at you, but you are the guy. Just for fun, think about how much fun it would be, just to be the foil, you know, and point out what an idiot this guy [Trump] is. Giles then encourages Flake to  foil  the  idiot  Trump in 2020, and the two continue yucking it up about how ridiculous the kinds of people who are emerging as the face of their party are. It took a staffer reminding Flake of the mic to stop the conversation, but we ve certainly heard enough to know where he stands on the current state of the GOP.So, in other words, Jeff Flake, who is one of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, is fed up with the extremism in the GOP. He clearly thinks people like Roy Moore and Donald Trump have zero business being anywhere near the levers of power, and yet here we are. Trump is in the Oval Office, and Moore is a heartbeat away from being seated in the United States Senate.Watch the comments below:Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News
 Donald Trump Is Destroying The Countryâ€™s Reputation And Hereâ€™s Proof,"During the election, when Donald Trump wasn t bellowing  Lock her up  about Hillary Clinton, he was manufacturing a narrative in which President Obama had turned our country into a dystopia in which we ve lost all respectability throughout the world.We need a President who isn't a laughing stock to the entire World. We need a truly great leader, a genius at strategy and winning. Respect!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 9, 2014  As usual, Trump was more about projection than the truth. We can t be sure if he knew he was going to destroy our reputation around the world, but he did. In a survey released on Thursday, our standing in the world tumbled all the way from number one to number six. The power and quality of each country s  brand image  was measured by the Nation Brands Index (NBI) survey, which was conducted by German-based market research firm GfK and British political consultant Simon Anholt. The final NBI score was decided after collecting public opinion on 50 different countries on primarily six categories: its  people,   governance,   exports,   tourism,   investment and immigration,  and  culture and heritage. According to popular public opinion, the U.S. dropped to the sixth place while Germany rose to claim the prestigious first spot. Germany stood second in the same survey last year while the first place was held by the U.S. After just a year, the U.S. is lagging behind Germany, France, Britain, Canada and Japan.Source: IBTimesThis isn t the first time the world has taken notice of the fact that we have a greedy, uncivilized, unethical half-wit at the helm of the largest economy and the largest military in the world.In September, a Pew poll found that the world favored Obama over Trump by a significant number. Out of 37 countries, only two liked Trump better. Only Russia (hmmmm) and Israel were happier with Trump. As for the rest of the world, the drop in popularity wasn t just in double digits, it was, as Trump might say, huuuuge! Only 10 percent of Swedes trust Trump not to start World War III. 93 percent of Swedish people trusted Obama. Okay, the survey didn t specify World War but it did ask if they trusted the U.S. president to handle world affairs.The rest of the world wasn t quite as dramatic, but as you can see from this chart below, the world really hates Trump.In July, his results were somewhat better, but he was still wildly hated by the majority of the world s citizens.This is a lot bigger deal than just a few statistics. It took a long time to build our standing in the world. Since World War II, right or wrong, the United States has been seen as a moral leader. We are certainly an economic leader. Now we have no leg to stand on, even when fighting for own interests. We may be witnessing the death of the world s longest living democracy and it s all because millions of people threw a temper tantrum over the fact that a black man was president and that a woman wanted to be president.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images.",News
 Trump Just Got His P*ssy Handed To Him By New Zealandâ€™s Female Prime Minister,"Donald Trump bit off a bit more than he could chew when he attempted to shoot some venom at New Zealand s newly-elected Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern during their first in-person meeting at the East Asia Summit last week.When Trump told her that her victory had  upset  citizens in her country, she hit back and his oranges testes shriveled up instantly. This lady caused a lot of upset in her country,  Trump reportedly told a person standing next to Ardern, promopting her to reply: No one marched when I was elected. She s correct. While Trump s inauguration failed to bring out supporters, marches across the nation in opposition of The Donald continued long after his election.Ardern says Trump  laughed  at her joke, but also reflected that it could have been taken in a very particular way. However Trump took it, he wasn t able to complete his traditional  power handshake  that has been embarrassing the country since his election. Ardern describes their handshake as  standard,  meaning Trump didn t try to yank her arm out of its socket as per usual.What s that word conservatives like to use and misuse? Oh, yes   Trump just got  cucked. ",News
 Chaos Ensues After Man Accidentally Shoots Himself And Wife In Church During Gun Safety Talk,"Maybe  thoughts and prayers  aren t the remedy following a shooting, after all. At the First United Methodist Church in East Tennessee, about 20 senior citizens gathered around for a holiday meal. After the meal, the group of elderly churchgoers decided to discuss gun safety. There has, after all, been a spate of mass shootings recently   as many as 317 so far this year. They got the idea for the conversation reportedly after a nearby county s sheriff s department held similar seminars at its local churches, according to Tellico Plains Police Chief Russ Parks. Well, I ve got my gun on me,  an 81-year-old member of the church in Tellico Plains said, according to Parks,  The Washington Post reports. The man then pulled out his holster in which he had a .38-caliber Ruger handgun. He promptly removed the magazine for everyone to see, then cleared the chamber and showed the gun to his fellow parishioners.The churchgoers discussed how to safely bring guns to church, then spoke of the deaths with recent mass shootings, like, for example, the recent Texas massacre in which a gunman shot 26 people dead as they sat in church.The 81-year-old man put the magazine back into the gun and put the gun back in the holster, Parks explained, but then later, while parishioners were cleaning up, one church member who had missed the demonstration asked the man to see the firearm   and that s when everything turned chaotic inside the church.The 81-year-old accidentally pulled the trigger without realizing the gun was loaded, then a bullet fired across the palm of the man s hand and toward his 80-year-old wife, who was sitting in a wheelchair next to him, entering her lower left abdomen, then it went out of the right side of her abdomen, into her right forearm and out the backside of her forearm. Following that, the bullet then ricocheted off the wall and landed under his wife s wheelchair, Parks said.That prompted panic in the church because some of the folks thought an active gunman was on the premises. They had their backs to it,  Parks said.  Somebody hollers,  He s been shot! She s been shot! Call 911! Due to a lot of panic during the calls to 911, the dispatcher assumed someone had entered the church and was shooting, so several schools were put on lockdown.The injured husband and wife were flown to the University of Tennessee Medical Center where they are listed critical condition.We re waiting for the NRA to say,  If only the wife had a gun, she could have protected herself.

 New Accuser Confirms She Got Roy Moore Banned From The Mall (VIDEOS),"Alabama Senate Candidate Roy Moore (R- Of Course) has a mounting list of women who say that he sexually harassed or assaulted them when they were teenagers. Another piece of that story is the rumor that Moore was so creepy with the girls that he was banned from a local mall in his hometown of Gadsden, Alabama. That rumor had been unsubstantiated   until now.Becky Gray was working at the Gadsden Mall when she encountered Roy Moore, then an assistant district attorney. She was in her early 20 s, and he was in his 30 s. She said that Moore had taken a  creepy  liking to her, and constantly visited her at the mall. According to Gray, Moore hung out at the mall on Friday and Saturday nights   like teenagers do. She says of the situation: I mean, you ve got to understand   when you re that age, somebody in their 30s might as well have been 40 or 50   to me anyway. He d come back through [the department store] and if I was working, he would stop by and chit chat and that sort of thing, and it just kind of got creepy to me. Every Friday and Saturday night, he was down at the mall. Nobody his age is at the mall! You know, parents are dropping off their 12 year olds and 13 year olds, 14 year olds. I mean, come on, I just thought that was really creepy even way back then. Roy Moore repeatedly harassed Becky Gray at work, and she went to her manager about his behavior: I went to my manager and talked to him about it and asked him, basically, what could be done. Later on, he came back through my department and told me that [Moore] had been banned from the mall. In addition to Becky Gray s account, there is an account that Moore was banned from the mall by a man named Greg Legat who also worked there at the time. Here is video of his confirmation:So, every bit of this is true, in other words. Roy Moore actually hung out at the mall in order to creep on little girls and young women working there or hanging out there with their friends. This man is completely unfit to be a United States Senator, and if the people of Alabama elect him, he should be immediately expelled.Here is video of Becky Gray s account of Moore s mall banning, via ABC News:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News

 Trump Admin. Tosses Out Another Obama Rule â€“ His Sons Can Be Even Worse Douchebags Now,"President Donald Trump has overturned another Obama-era legislation, this time the 2014 ban on trophy hunting permits, particularly those of elephants killed in Zimbabwe and Zambia, a US Fish and Wildlife Service official has confirmed. Trump s sons, Don Jr., and Eric, love being trophy-hunting douchebags and this will allow them to be even more blatant about it.Don Jr., has hunted elephants before, and elephants are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. That exact act also contained a provision that allows for the granting of permits for the trophy-hunting of elephants if the hunters can prove that the demise of the singular animal in question helped benefit the conservation of the entire species. It s unlikely the Trump sons care about conservation, and only about their own glory and bragging rights.Nevertheless, a spokesman for Fish and Wildlife said,  Legal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit the conservation of certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve the species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation. Despite large-scale conservation efforts, the wild elephant population in Africa plummeted 30% overall between 2007 and 2014 and by as much as 75% in some areas as a result of ivory poaching, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. Prior to European colonization in the early 20th century, it is estimated that the wild elephant population in Africa was approximately 20 million, but dropped to 1.7 million by 1979. That number looks even more bleak when at last count in 2016 there were only just over 352,000 of the animals remaining on Africa s savanna in a survey where Namibia did not release any figures and surveys in South Sudan and the Central African Republic were postponed due to armed conflict.Last year, 182 countries signed an agreement to end the legal ivory trade in domestic markets, however, Zimbabwe is one of few that has tried to have that ban lifted and soon they may be successful with the help of President Trump. This new change would only apply to Zimbabwe and Zambia, but with Robert Mugabe s recent removal and the military seizing control of Zimbabwe, they have bigger issues to deal with at the moment.It makes you wonder why President Trump would be so interested in elephant poaching. Is it another distraction, this time from the possibility of Zimbabwe falling into a constitutional crisis? Could it be because he just likes the look of ivory in Trump Tower?Or is it simply because Trumps just miss slaughtering endangered wildlife for the sheer pleasure of it?Figures. pic.twitter.com/7LrFJeqaIY  Snarkar?ni  ?

Roy Moore has tried to compare his scandal to Franken s inappropriate behavior, but only one of the men admitted they were wrong, called for an investigation, and apologized. Only one man perved on high school girls, one as young as 14-years-old. We re not justifying Franken s behavior. We re simply saying that Moore, a staunch right-wing Christian, has failed to admit to any wrongdoing, despite the fact that there are nine accusers and at least 30 people to corroborate the alleged victims  stories. At least Franken admitted what happened and he took the steps to immediately address the accusations.Photo by Molly Riley-Pool/Getty Images",News
 Anti-Gay GOP Rep Gets BUSTED For Having Inappropriate Relations With A Man In His State Office,"Republicans are hypocrites.And Ohio state GOP Rep. Wes Goodman proved it this week after he got caught having an affair with a man.Normally, having an affair with a man would not be a big deal. After all, same-sex marriage is legal and relationships with men is no longer the scandal it once was. But Goodman is a conservative  Christian  Republican who is married to a woman, so his affair with a member of the same sex is absolutely scandalous.So scandalous, in fact, that Goodman resigned from his post on Wednesday. We all bring our own struggles and our own trials into public life,  Goodman said in a statement.  That has been true for me, and I sincerely regret that my actions and choices have kept me from serving my constituents and our state in a way that reflects the best ideals of public service. For those whom I have let down, I m sorry. As I move onto the next chapter of my life, I sincerely ask for privacy for myself, my family, and my friends. Sorry, Mr. Goodman. But you don t get privacy nor can you expect to not be mercilessly mocked.Goodman preached  family values  and thinks same-sex marriage should be illegal and that gay people should be punished for being gay. He even bragged about being committed to  natural marriage  on his own campaign website.Ohio House Speaker Cliff Rosenberger accepted Goodman s resignation after he confirmed the allegations during a meeting. I was alerted to details yesterday afternoon regarding his involvement in inappropriate behavior related to his state office,  Rosenburger said.  I met with him later in the day where he acknowledged and confirmed the allegations. It became clear that his resignation was the most appropriate course of action for him, his family, the constituents of the 87th House District and this institution. Frankly, affairs like this shouldn t matter as long as the relations were consensual. But the fact that Goodman was fiercely anti-gay and carried on the affair in his taxpayer funded office makes it newsworthy and even more explosive.Here s a report on the story via YouTube.Featured Image: Screenshot",News
 That Time Trump Mocked Marco Rubio For Drinking Water Just Came Back To Haunt Him,"While on the campaign trail, candidate Donald Trump, a former reality show star, repeatedly mocked Sen. Marco Rubio for that time he drank water on the stage. Trump mocked Rubio at rallies about that and on Twitter, too. As they say, with this guy, there really is a tweet for everything. Trump did this after he kicked off his day blasting that  loser  network CNN, the  failing  New York Times and demanded a  thank you  from the UCLA basketball players who arrived in the states after being released from China. Then he summarized his trip to Asia, declaring it to be  the longest visit to the region by an American president in more than a quarter of a century.  He added that  America is back and the future has never looked better.  Then he seemed to have difficulty breathing and paused for water.Here is Trump doing that think he disparaged Rubio for doing:more proof that we're living in a simulation pic.twitter.com/7fGMxvRKUj  kevin driscoll (@kevndriscoll) November 15, 2017Trump grabbed a bottle of Fiji to quench his thirst, the exact brand that Rubio drank during the campaign. The Florida Republican responded on Twitter, saying,  Similar, but needs work on his form. Has to be done in one single motion & eyes should never leave the camera. But not bad for his 1st time.

 WATCH: Corporate CEOs SHOCK Trumpâ€™s Economic Adviser With Truth About GOP Tax Cuts,"Trump s economic adviser, Gary Cohn, has bought into the GOP s tax plan lock, stock and barrel to the point where he likely has a deep belief that trickle-down economics actually works. The thing is, it doesn t, and at a Wall Street Journal event packed full of CEOs, Cohn seemed absolutely stunned that this crowd of corporate leaders wouldn t automatically say they d use the GOP s tax cuts to invest in their own companies.An editor from the Wall Street Journal asked the audience: If the tax reform bill goes through, do you plan to increase investment   your company s investment, capital investment? Only a few of them raised their hands indicating they would. Cohn s response was: Why aren t the other hands up? Really? Well, yes, really. It seems so easy to Cohn, apparently. One might even think that he genuinely doesn t understand why most of the CEOs in the room kept their hands down. Cohn now looks incredibly ignorant and stupid.Corporate tax cuts do not result in greater capital investment and these CEOs know it. Anybody who knows anything about business and economics (and even modern history) knows it. It s really quite simple: CEOs will not invest in things like new machinery, new factories, or new jobs when they don t have enough customer demand to justify it.In fact, most money saved from these kinds of tax cuts go toward stock buybacks, which is a controversial practice in which a company buys back its own stock to artificially drive prices up and put more money into the pockets of shareholders and the C-suite. CEO pay also tends to go up when taxes go down.CEOs know this. They want the tax cuts for precisely this reason. Their greed has gotten the best of them and they know tax cuts will make them richer. But they can t, and won t, commit to using the money they ll save on taxes to expanding operations and creating jobs because if they do, they create a PR nightmare for themselves.Watch Cohn get shocked below:1. Tax-overhaul backers say corporate rate cut will encourage investment by businesses 2. During #wsjceocouncil interview with Gary Cohn, WSJ asks CEOs to raise hands if they ll boost investment if rates cut 3. Few CEOS raise hands 4.

 Texas Sheriff Threatens To Jail Truck Owner For Anti-Trump Sticker (SCREENSHOTS),"Good news everyone! All crime in Texas has been solved. How do we know this? Because Fort Bend County Sheriff Troy E. Nehls has announced that he s going on a crusade against protected political speech.Apparently, the Sheriff saw someone s anti-Trump sticker he placed on his truck and decided to take action pleasing the tortured little snowflakes who contacted him about it but also showing that not only he but an unnamed prosecutor is corrupt as f*ck. I have received numerous calls regarding the offensive display on this truck as it is often seen along FM 359. If you know who owns this truck or it is yours, I would like to discuss it with you,  the Sheriff posted on Facebook Wednesday.  Our Prosecutor has informed us she would accept Disorderly Conduct charges regarding it, but I feel we could come to an agreement regarding a modification to it. Yes, disorderly conduct. For a sticker. Because it s anti-Trump.Sorry, Sheriff. No  agreement  is necessary, as it is not a crime to criticize the President or people who voted for him. Naturally, Americans stopped by to laugh at the sheriff who claims that saying mean things about Trump constitutes an  immediate breach of the peace :       Unfortunately for the Sheriff, this matter was decided in the 1971 Supreme Court case, Cohen v. California. A man was convicted for disturbing the peace by wearing a  f*ck the draft  jacket, but the Supreme Court told those who would abuse the justice system by punishing protected political speech to f*ck off.Unfortunately, the goal here isn t to successfully prosecute someone. It s to make sure that the owner of the truck pays for being mean to Trump.Featured image via screengrab",News
 WATCH: Delusional Trump Fans Lash Out At Fox Host For Reporting Facts Of Uranium One Deal,"Clearly, Trump supporters want Fox News to lie to them.Because when Fox News host Shep Smith fact-checked Donald Trump s accusations against Hillary Clinton in regards to the Uranium One deal with Russia, they lost their shit.Smith thoroughly debunked Republican claims that Hillary Clinton approved the deal in a pay-to-play scam during her time as Secretary of State back in 2010.First, the deal had to be approved by a committee of nine agency heads, who unanimously approved.Second, the State Department was represented by an assistant who says Clinton did not intervene.Third, the Uranium One deal stipulates that the uranium must be sold to civilian reactor operators in the United States, which blows Trump s claim that Hillary gave 20 percent of our uranium to Russia out of the water.Fourth, one man gave the Clinton Foundation all but $4 million of the $140 million donated by nine individuals associated with Uranium One. And that one man had already sold his stake in the company years before in 2007, well before Clinton even thought about being Secretary of State. And long before Barack Obama became president to make her Secretary of State.And, finally, Clinton had no power to veto or approve the deal herself.So, that means conservatives have no case against Clinton, effectively neutering any effort by the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor since doing so is contingent on the facts. And the facts support Clinton. So much so, that any court would laugh the obviously manufactured charges out of court.Here s the video via YouTube.In response, Trump supporters threw a temper tantrum and called for Fox to fire Smith for reporting the facts.You need to get that hack @ShepNewsTeam out of Fox. He just made excuses for #CrookedHillary and is clearly a double agent. Hey Shep.. Hillary took the 145M regardless of when it was sent. Pay for play you goof  Lab Lover (@Dutchistheballs) November 14, 2017Chris Wallace and Shepard Smith should start a show on CNN called ""Pink Hat Brigade"" that's where you both belong. Shameful Fox, Get rid of these two asshats.  Matt Couch ? (@RealMattCouch) November 13, 2017@FoxNews if I wanted to see an unfactual and slanted view I would watch CNN. I can t watch Shepard Smith anymore. I m dont with that show. He is arrogant and clearly anti trump  Jim Hennahane (@limabean002) November 14, 2017And these are just a few of the MANY angry conservative tweets calling for Smith to be fired. However, a majority of the tweets came in support of Smith and his fact-based reporting, which blew apart the rest of the network s effort to spin the deal into a nefarious scandal proving that Hillary colluded with the Russians.Seriously.Shep Smith did his job as a journalist. Sean Hannity could certainly learn a lot from Smith. The Uranium One scandal being pushed by Trump and his minions has been repeatedly debunked. Conservatives are desperately attacking Clinton to distract from Trump s real scandals. But Smith refuses to lie to make Trump look good. And that s the real reason why Trump supporters hate him so much.Featured Image: Screenshot ",News
 Roy Moore Supporting Republican LOSES It After Being Called An Extremist,"If the scandal around the stories of Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore s accusations of dating of teenage girls is accomplishing anything, it s drawing a line in the sand. Republicans are having to declare themselves either pro-pedophilia or anti.You d think it would be an easy choice to make, but hey, we have an accused pedophile in the White House, so maybe not so easy for the GOP party. Even Ted Cruz, though, who is one of the most extreme in Washington (and one of the most loathed) has withdrawn his support of Moore.One Republican, though, is holding on and he s shocked (I tell you) that anyone would ever call him an extremist over it.Rob Maness, who has the endorsement of Sarah Palin, Rand Paul, Rick Perry and Ben Carson, is running for the Louisiana State House. During a radio interview, a caller called Maness  an extremist,  precisely because he s to the right of Ted Cruz, at least on the subject of statutory rape.The caller went by the moniker of  flaming liberal  for WGSO-AM. His real name, though, is David Bellinger. He said about Maness,  If you re to the right of Ted Cruz, you re an extremist.  Hard to argue that since there is pretty much no one more extreme than Cruz, who believes that Planned Parenthood sells body parts and that the states can ignore the Supreme Court s ruling making gay marriage legal. Maness was having none of that accusation. Whoa, you just called me an extremist, brother,  said Maness, a retired Air Force colonel who went on to outline his military background, including top-secret clearances. I ve done everything this country has ever asked me to do. How dare you call me an extremist,  he said.  I m the most investigated, stable man that the country could have ever given the keys to nuclear weapons to, so you can blow me! You can blow me and get out of here if you re gonna talk like that and call me an extremist. Source: The AdvocateJust two things here: Maness is not running for an office where he would get the keys to nuclear weapons and well, his answer doesn t make him seem a very  stable man. Bellinger shot back, Go screw your ma, asshole,  several times.Maness, still fuming, said: I m not going to listen to that crap,  he said after jettisoning Bellinger.  Nobody s gonna call me an extremist, because I m not one. The extremists are the people who are liars, and the hypocrites and the swamp creatures from Washington, D.C. and Baton Rouge and all around the nation, even at the local level, that have got their political power and they try to smear people like me because we want to take it away from them.

 That Story Trump Just Told The Press About Obama And Air Force One NEVER Happened,"On Tuesday, Donald Trump told a story about Air Force One and former President Barack Obama. The only problem is that it never happened. Before boarding the plane to come home, Trump told the press that Air Force One was denied landing rights in the Philippines during a trip by his predecessor because U.S. relations with the nation were so bad.Trump said Air Force One  never got to land  in the Philippines while be bragged about having  a very strong relationship  with the Southeast Asian nation. And as you know, we were having a lot of problems with the Philippines. The relationship with the past administration was horrible, to use a nice word,  Trump told reporters in Manila. I would say  horrible  is putting it mildly. You know what happened. Many of you were there, and you never got to land,  he continued.  The plane came close but it didn t land. The Associated Press fact-checked Trump s bizarre claim:President Barack Obama last visited the Philippines in November 2015, arriving in Manila after an overnight flight from Turkey. There were no problems with landing the plane. Obama used the visit to announce the United States was transferring two ships to the Philippine Navy.Perhaps Trump was referring erroneously to Obama s aborted meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte? In September 2016, Obama abruptly canceled a meeting with the new Philippines leader in Laos after Duterte called him an obscene name. Duterte was warning Obama not to speak with him about the brutality of his crackdown on the illegal drug trade.Obama did visit the Philippines on several trips earlier in his presidency and even signed an enhanced defense cooperation agreement with the country in 2014, but Trump claimed that our relationship with the Philipines is  probably better than ever before. So it s very important that we get along with the Philippines, and we really do. We have a very good relationship. I would actually say probably better than ever before,  he said.Duterte has carried out an unlawful crackdown on suspected drug dealers and users, resulting in at least 7 thousand deaths by means including execution using death squads. Hitler massacred 3 million Jews. There are 3 million drug addicts. I d be happy to slaughter them,  Duterte declared in 2015.However, while Trump was there he largely ignored any discussion of human rights with the dictator. We understand that Trump is jealous of President Obama, but his lies prove why he has so much disdain for fact-checkers. It s sad that he doesn t have that same disdain for murderous dictators, though.Photo by Zach Gibson   Pool/Getty Images.",News
 This 4-Year Old Tweet From Donald Trump Shows Us Heâ€™s AT LEAST As Perverted As Roy Moore,"After Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was finally publicly outed after decades of alleged sexual abuses toward women, a #metoo hashtag formed and a dam broke. Suddenly it seemed that every time we turned on our computers, every time we received a phone alert, it was yet another man outed as an abuser.The worst of the worst of sexual abusers, though, are those who abuse children. Roy Moore, the right-wing Christian nut-job who s running for Senate in Alabama has been accused of doing just that. Five women have now come forward alleging that Moore  dated  them and worse while they were teens and he was in his 30s.This all began almost a year to the day after an audio tape of Donald Trump bragging about how he s such a big star he can just grab women s pussies. Is it possible, though, that Trump is as bad, if not worse, than Moore?While liberals and Democrats have decried the alleged abusers, regardless of ideology or party affiliation, Republicans have taken a *shall we say* more nuanced stance when it comes to Moore. They have invoked the Bible, saying that the Virgin Mary was a teenager when Jesus was born. Of course, much like they forget the  well regulated militia  part of the Second Amendment, these men who would slut shame their own sisters if they were Democrats who wanted birth control, suddenly forgot the first part of Mary s moniker. They also defended Moore by saying that he was just a fragile young buck of 32, who couldn t have possibly known better, while his alleged victims were well on their way to adulthood at 14 and 16.Donald Trump has been surprisingly mum about the Moore allegations, but spokesperson Kellyanne Conway carefully straddled the line by saying that  if  the allegations were true, Moore should resign. Trump, though, had something interesting to say about the subject of statutory rape three years ago. In a tweet, Trump called it  talent  to  date  a woman who s young enough to be his daughter. Note: he was married to Melania at the time.@rexrode_lisa ""@realDonaldTrump you date girls young enough to be your daughter.That's perverted"" Dated. No, that's talent.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 23, 2013  This wasn t the first time Trump expressed interest in young girls. At least twice, Trump was heard saying that he would soon be dating girls who, at the time, were very underaged.Donald Trump once told 14-year-old girls, 'In a couple of years, I'll be dating you' https://t.co/nslYeqp8dg pic.twitter.com/ayDeW6nGNz  L.A. Times Politics (@latimespolitics) October 13, 2016  In 1992, he said about a 10-year-old girl that he would be  dating her in 10 years.  Here s the video:All of this, of course, was out there before the election and Trump voters didn t care. Trump voters in Alabama don t care about the allegations against Moore either. A poll taken after the accusations began to surface showed Moore with a 10 point lead against his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones. If we haven t thrown in the moral towel as a country, Republicans certainly have. Jerry Falwell s moral majority has turned into an immoral minority of right-wing ideologues who would pimp out their own daughters if it meant putting another Republican in Congress.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images.",News
 OOPS: Trump Judicial Nominee Didnâ€™t Tell Congress About Marriage To White House Attorney,"This is a major conflict of interest that should automatically disqualify him.When the Senate Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to approve Donald Trump s nomination of Brett Talley to a federal judgeship in Alabama, they did so without knowing that Talley is married to White House lawyer Ann Donaldson, who is the chief of staff to White House counsel Donald McGahn.That s a pretty big detail to leave out of a disclosure form.According to the New York Times,Mr. Talley was asked on his publicly released Senate questionnaire to identify family members and others who are  likely to present potential conflicts of interest.  He did not mention his wife.District judges often provide the first ruling when laws are called into question, decisions that can put them at odds with the White House and its lawyers. Last month, for example, judges in Hawaii and Maryland temporarily blocked Mr. Trump s travel ban.Mr. Talley also did not mention his wife when he described his frequent contact with White House lawyers during the nomination process.Talley has also never tried a case in his life, making him even more unqualified to be a judge. In fact, the American Bar Association judged Tally as  unqualified  for the position in a very rare unanimous decision.The Senate could hold a confirmation vote as early as Monday, and it is important that they reject Talley, especially since he lied to them by omission.If Republicans confirm Talley, they will be telling future nominees that it s okay to lie to Congress in order to get an important job. That should not be allowed to happen. Trump and Republicans often claim that immigration should be based on merit. Well, becoming a federal judge should definitely be based on merit, not based on who you re married to and whether you ll be a rubber stamp for a corrupt administration.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images ",News
 Trump Laughs After Philippine Leader Calls Journalists â€˜Spiesâ€™ In Country Where Journalists Are Routinely Murdered,"Donald Trump probably wishes the United States was more like the Philippines.Trump was downright chummy with mass murderer and human rights violator Rodrigo Duterte on Monday during the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Summit in Manila.Not only did Trump refuse to nail Duterte for violating human rights, he laughed when Duterte accused journalists of being  spies  when they peppered the dictatorial duo with questions about human rights. We would be talking on matters that are of interest of both the Philippines and  With you around guys, you are the spies,  Duterte said, drawing laughter from Trump.Bloomber reporter Jennifer Jacobs chronicled how Duterte and Trump treated journalists at the Summit.Duterte made a joke at end of Trump bilat.As press being shooed out, Duterte said:  We will be talking on matters of interest to both the Philippines and Then he said:  With you around, guys, you are the spies.

You may leave the room,  Duterte says, just minutes into summit meeting.Press ushered out. pic.twitter.com/lhfFgp3xJU  Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) November 13, 2017Trump has been attacking the media since he announced his candidacy back in 2015. And he has relentlessly attacked the media since taking office, accusing journalists of writing or reporting  fake news. Ever since he became the Philippine leader, Duterte has been responsible for the killing of 100,000 people, casualties of a war on drugs Duterte promised to wage during his campaign.President Obama was a sharp critic of Duterte, and Duterte retaliated by calling him the  son of a whore  and sought closer ties with China and Russia. Of course, Trump likes Duterte and has avoided calling him out for his abuse of power. Trump even invited Duterte to the White House.Trump s amusement at Duterte s remarks about journalists are particularly alarming since the Philippines is one of the most deadly places on Earth for journalists.Newsweek reports that 177 journalists have been killed there since 1986.And Trump added further insult to injury by not even discussing Duterte s terrible human rights record. Instead, he let Duterte do all the talking and merely nodded in agreement with him. Once again, Trump demonstrates that he is a coward who can be walked over by other world leaders. Conservatives bitched and moaned whenever President Obama bowed to greet some world leaders. But apparently they are okay with Trump just laying down.Featured Image: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News
 Watch: Joe Biden Just Wrecked Trump In Six Words And Itâ€™s Hilarious,"Former Vice President Joe Biden was asked on Monday by Matt Lauer on NBC s  Today  to name something specific that Donald Trump has been  doing well. Well, that seems like a trick question since Trump has passed no major legislation and reaches across the aisle only to take shots at Democrats in his Twitter timeline during his morning rage-tweets, so Biden struggled to find something, anything, that Trump has done well since taking office. I think there s a number of things he s doing well. But even the things he s doing well, it s how he does them,  Biden said. It s more the tone of this administration that bothers me,  he continued. With all due respect, you haven t come up with one thing you think he s doing well,  Lauer said. Well, I think he married very well,  Biden joked.Although, Biden didn t mention which of Trump s three marriages he s speaking of. Trump s first marriage to Ivana ended after he had an affair with Marla Maples. Trump went on to marry Maples, then they divorced. Trump is currently married to Melania. All three of Trump s wives are former models. Trump is a former reality show star. But, in all instances, he did marry up, since there is no  down  that Trump hasn t hit yet.After struggling to come up with something, Biden eventually praised Trump s choice of keeping military personnel stationed in the Middle East that was there at the end of the Obama administration.Watch:""What do you think Trump is doing well?""""I think he married very well.""Joe Biden answers questions on @TODAYshow https://t.co/F6EKxHe64M  NBC News (@NBCNews) November 13, 2017In January, Biden had some advice for Trump.

 BUSTED: Leaked Documents Prove Trump Took Laundered Money From Russian Bank,"Convincing President Trump to release his tax returns is proving slightly more difficult than we initially anticipated, but that doesn t mean there haven t been any signs of success from taking the longer route. Take, for example, a 98-page document recently released by the United States Office of Government Ethics.The document, available in its entirety here, clearly shows that not only is Donald Trump outright profiting from the presidency, a direct violation of the Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution but also that he is in debt to several banks, both domestic and foreign.Although shocking news, none of this particularly comes as a surprise, more or less just confirms what most of us already suspected. However, it s when you delve into the details that you discover the true significance of the President s possible under-the-table actions.German-based Deutsche Bank was served with $630 million in penalties back in January for a $10 billion Russian money laundering scheme involving it s Moscow and New York branches among others. Deutsche Bank also gave Trump four questionable long-term  loans,  potentially Russian money that s been handed to Trump, the final loan given just before the commencement of the presidential election and used to help fund the Trump International Hotel that opened in Washington DC last year.Obviously, this interaction between Trump and Deutsche Bank should raise more than just a few red flags, at least confirming that there is a possibility that the Russians laundered money to Trump as he began his campaign and just prior to hiring senior advisors with ties to the Russian government.Furthermore, Deutsche Bank is gaining somewhat of a reputation for their shady business dealings as well. Not only were they caught in the Russian laundering scheme, the bank also struck a $7.2 billion deal with the US government last December to settle claims for toxic mortgages they packaged and sold between 2005 and 2007, as well as paying $2.5 billion in April 2015 to settle charges it conspired to manipulate global interest rate benchmarks.It s interesting, yet not at all surprising, how corrupt people and organizations just seem to gravitate toward each other.Featured image via Getty/Drew Angerer and screenshot",News
" Perverted GOP State Rep. Corners Lobbyist, Tries To Force Her To Help With His â€˜Raging B**nerâ€™","The Republican Party is having a terrible week when it comes to the perverts in their ranks being outed. First, there s the fact that Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore has been accused of  dating  girls as young as 14, and actually molesting said 14-year-old. What s worse is the fact that instead of demanding that Moore leave the race, many Alabama Republicans have been defending him. One of them, Alabama GOP Auditor Jim Ziegler, even used the Bible as a justification for Moore s alleged actions.Now, the GOP has another mess on their hands when it comes to perversion in their ranks: Minnesota State Rep. Tony Cornish. The Star Tribune obtained a text message Cornish sent to a fellow lawmaker, in which he joked about how aroused he was while looking at her on the State House Floor. The Star Tribune says of the text message they received: Maye Quade, first elected in 2016, provided the Star Tribune with a text message from Cornish in May 2017 in which he wrote that he  got busted for staring at you on the House floor   Haha. I told him it was your fault, of course. Look too damned good. Ha. I must be more gentlemanly when I run for governor. As if that were not bad enough, there s Cornish s treatment of a female lobbyist in his office. The lobbyist alleges that Cornish trapped her in the office and insisted that she help him with his, quote,  raging boner.  City Pages says of that incident: The most disturbing allegations against Cornish come from a lobbyist who asked to have her identity protected. The lobbyist says Cornish engaged in a years-long campaign of harassment, soliciting her for sex in text messages   she rebuffed him   and once pushing her against a wall in his office and trying to kiss her.On another occasion, during a meeting in his office, the woman says she was attempting to leave when Cornish stood up and pointed down, saying:  I have a raging boner. You can t leave.  This, the lobbyist says, Cornish said twice; she did leave, anyway.And let s remember   for every one of these incidences that gets reported, there s usually bunches more that don t, because of the way people who come forward regarding being sexually harassed and assaulted are treated.Get your act together, GOP.

 All Of Roy Mooreâ€™s Former Colleagues Knew He Liked â€˜Datingâ€™ Teenage Girls,"In the late 1970 s, Alabama Senate Candidate Roy Moore (R- Of Course) would have been in his early 30 s. However, he liked little girls   literally. A bombshell report in the Washington Post alleges that Moore, who was 32 in 1979, approached Leigh Corfman in a courthouse. Corfman was 14 at the time. Moore picked the little girl up near her home, drove her to his home in the woods, and proceeded to molest her, according to the story. Now, this is the man who is running for the United States Senate. The thing is, though, Moore s political career should have been over and done with decades ago.You see, according to people who worked with Roy Moore at the time, it was, quote,  common knowledge  that he liked dating high schoolers. Moore s former colleague Theresa Jones, who was a Deputy District Attorney with Moore at the time, says of the situation: It was common knowledge that Roy dated high school girls, everyone we knew thought it was weird We wondered why someone his age would hang out at high school football games and the mall but you really wouldn t say anything to someone like that. Jones went on to urge others who know firsthand what Roy Moore is like to come forward:Original tweet by Teresa Jones: ""I have no doubt these stories [about Roy Moore] have validity."" pic.twitter.com/oPWaeKrS8W  Alexander Marquardt (@MarquardtA) November 11, 2017Well, it s honestly not  dating  when it s a 30-something year old man and little girls. That s pedophilia. We must not conflate the two. Secondly, this is today s Republican Party. This is where we re at- where one of America s two major political parties thinks it s A-OKAY to try and get a pedophile elected to the United States Senate.It really is too bad that more people didn t out Roy Moore as the pedophile that he was all those years ago. Perhaps the American people would not be in the situation we re in right now if they had   with this disgusting man on the brink of becoming a United States Senator.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News
 WATCH: Christian Right Founder Condemns Them For Supporting Nazis And Sexual Misconduct,"The religious right movement is not the same movement anymore.And Frank Schaeffer would know. After all, he helped his father create it.The movement originally began as an anti-abortion organization specifically designed to bring angry Christians to the voting booth. But has since become something even more insidious.In recent years, conservative  Christians  have become one giant hate group that supports Nazism and rape while working to strip women, minorities and gay people of their constitutional rights.During an appearance on AM Joy on Saturday, Schaeffer roundly condemned the Christian Right and the Republican Party in a smack down of Biblical proportion taking particular aim at Roy Moore and Donald Trump, whom conservatives are supporting despite several sexual abuse and assault allegations against them and Trump s own refusal to condemn Nazis. Back in the day when my dad and me were going around the country establishing the religious right based on our anti-abortion stand, one I ve moved a long way from since, the whole idea was bringing America back to some moral stand,  Schaeffer began. Think about the Republican Party now,  Schaeffer continued.  Throw some words out that are associated with them: mass shootings, Milo, Trump, Moore, Bannon, rape, child molesting, neo-Nazis, white supremacy. What the hell is going on with the Republican Party? I m not shocked by Donald Trump, he s an ass. I m not shocked by Roy Moore. he s a loud mouth, a gun-toting fool. What I m shocked by is the complicity. We are in a political climate that s built on one lie after another. I just want to say for the record, by the way, I believe a woman who stands up, which is very difficult to do and comes forward with a story like that. She was a Trump voter. She s a Republican. I believe her. I just want to say that as a father and grandfather and someone that respects women that I believe her. Here s the video via YouTube.Conservative  Christians  and Republicans should pay attention to what Schaeffer says. Clearly, the movement he helped create has turned into a monster that is far removed from the teachings of Jesus and the Bible. That is evidenced by the fact that conservatives are perverting the Bible to defend Moore s predatory behavior.It s time for the American people to wake up and put an end to the Christian Right. They have never represented the values of the American people and they work every day to undermine our nation in an effort to turn it into their perverted and hateful version of a Christian utopia. Their insanity must be stopped.Featured Image: Screenshot",News
 Conservative â€˜Christianâ€™ Leader Defends Pedophile GOP Candidate Roy Moore,"It didn t take long for conservative  Christians  to jump to the defense of Roy Moore.Not long after the Washington Post published a story containing detailed accusations from several women who claim that Moore sexually assaulted and abused them as teens, conservatives disgustingly continued to back him despite having the opposite reaction to allegations against several high profile Hollywood actors and producers.And that s not to mention the reaction conservatives had when right-wing websites pushed a conspiracy claiming that Hillary Clinton ran a sex trafficking operation inside a pizza restaurant, a conspiracy that was immediately and thoroughly debunked.Conservatives STILL believe that conspiracy, but refuse to believe the very real victims who have come forward about Moore.Rather than call for Moore to step aside, conservative  Christians  are more rabid than ever, and that includes Jerry Falwell Jr., who along with the rest of his anti-gay friends still supports Moore just like they continued to support Donald Trump despite Trump saying on tape that he likes to grab women by their genitals without their consent. It comes down to a question who is more credible in the eyes of the voters   the candidate or the accuser,  Falwell said.  The same thing happened to President Trump a few weeks before his election last year except it was several women making allegations. He denied that any of them were true and the American people believed him and elected him the 45th president of the United States. And I believe the judge is telling the truth. So Falwell Jr. is making Moore s guilt contingent on whether voters elect him or not. In other words, he s telling Republican voters that electing him is the equivalent of a jury verdict of  not guilty. But that s not how the justice system works. And it s not how we should be judging political candidates.It should be pointed out that the race in Alabama has turned into a dead heat according to a poll taken after the bombshell story dropped, so clearly voters must not think Moore is very credible.These are credible allegations that should be taken seriously. Seriously enough that Moore should be forced to withdraw his candidacy. The fact that conservatives are using the Bible to defend sexual abuse and assault proves that they are nothing more than fake Christians. They would support a pedophile rather than vote for a Democrat. That s how far conservative  Christians  have fallen. They are literally supporting a man who claimed that homosexuality causes pedophilia, the same man who is being accused of predatory sexual behavior involving a 14-year-old girl. Only Moore is a straight white  Christian  so conservatives think his pedophilia is acceptable.Hillary Clinton was right. These people are deplorable.Featured Image: Scott Olson/Getty Images",News
 Trump Throws Intelligence Community Under The Bus To Side With Putin Despite Strong Evidence Of Russian Meddling,"President Bone Spurs finally made it to Vietnam over 40 years too late this week, and he used the occasion to stab our intelligence community in the back again.While taking questions from reporters on Air Force One, Donald Trump was asked if he still believes Vladimir Putin s denial that Russia interfered with the 2016 Election even though the evidence proves that Russia meddled.Of course, Trump is Putin s puppet so he was quick to throw U.S. officials and U.S. agencies under a speeding bus to side with the Russian dictator. He said he didn t meddle, he said he didn t meddle,  Trump said.  I asked him again. You can only ask so many times. I just asked him again. He said he absolutely did not meddle in our election, he did not do what they are saying he did. As we all know, 17 agencies, including the FBI and CIA agree that Russian interfered with the 2016 Election. There is so much evidence that Trump is being investigated for colluding with Russia, not only by a special prosecutor, but by Congress as well.We also know that Trump s own son met with Kremlin-connected Russian officials at Trump Tower seeking their help. Not long after that meeting, Trump urged Russia to hack Hillary Clinton s emails and the DNC.Trump went on to claim that the  whole thing was set up by the Democrats  and desperately defended Putin again. Every time he sees me he says I didn t do that and I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it. But he says I didn t do that. I think he is very insulted by it, if you want to know the truth. Don t forget. All he said was he never did that, he didn t do that. I think he is very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country. Then Trump attacked the intelligence community officials who have testified under oath that Russia meddled with our democratic process. They re political hacks. So you look at it, and then you have Brennan, you have Clapper and you have Comey. Comey s proven now to be a liar and he s proven to be a leaker. So you look at that. And you have President Putin very strongly, vehemently says he had nothing to do with that. And there you have it. Trump would rather believe the word of a Russian dictator over the word of several high ranking American officials who spent most of their lives dedicated to keeping America and our democratic institutions safe.That alone should outrage the American people.Featured Image: Steffen Kugler /BPA via Getty Images",News
 This Old Mike Pence Tweet Sure Is Uncomfortable Now That The G In MAGA Means Grope,"GOP candidate Roy Moore is accused of sexually molesting a 14-year-old girl when he was 32-years-old and several of the state s officials have said they would still support him even if the allegations are true because it s better than voting for a Democrat. Some Republicans have called for Moore to step down  if  the accusations are true, even though they ve been backed up by 30 people and there are four accusers. Leigh Corfman, who voted for Donald Trump in 2016, said she was 14 years old when she met Moore, who later took her to his home. While there, she said Moore removed her shirt and pants, then he removed his clothes. Moore then allegedly touched her over her bra and underwear, and put her hand on his crotch.So Vice-President Mike Pence, a right-wing Christian, has stated that he found the allegations in the story  disturbing and believes, if true, this would disqualify anyone from serving in office.  Except that Pence s boss has been accused by numerous women of sexual misconduct and somehow, Trump supporters have always been cool with that.This unfortunate tweet sent out by Pence in late September is coming back at him fast AF.

With 30 people, not including the four accusers, backing up the explosive story outing Moore as a sexual predator, one would think that this is a no-brainer and distance themselves from him.

 Newsweek Just Made Their BEST Cover Ever And People Are Freaking Out,"Newsweek has never been a publication to shy away from controversy, but the upcoming issue that hits newsstands on November 10 will take things to a whole new level. Not only does the cover raise the question of the current Trump administration being the most corrupt in US history, it also features the following image flanked by the headline  Snakes on a Plane,  referencing the 2006 film starring Samuel L. Jackson:New cover story: Trump is leading the most corrupt administration in U.S. history, one of first-class kleptocrats https://t.co/3KUQGPiOFR pic.twitter.com/wKvs93XsJ0  Newsweek (@Newsweek) November 2, 2017For those of you who need a little help making out the image, that is President Trump straddling a jet named the  Government Air  while throwing fistfuls of cash skyward with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin sitting behind him tossing a few dollars more. Mnuchin s wife, Scottish actress Louise Linton, is next in line, just holding on for dear life, with Education Secretary Nancy DeVos at the end throwing some money into the air as well. Former HHS Secretary Tom Price can also be seen plummeting to earth, an obvious reference to the ex-congressman s unexpected departure from the Trump administration. The inclusion of Mnuchin, Linton, and Price is also most likely in reference to the scandals they ve faced in regards to taxpayer-funded air travel.Things only get worse for Trump and his cabinet once the reader opens the issue. In a cover story written by Alexander Nazaryan titled  Trump is Leading the Most Corrupt Administration in U.S. History, One of First-Class Kleptocrats,  Trump s cabinet is exposed for their use of taxpayer money for lavish and completely unnecessary expenses such as vacations and extra security detail. Ironic, considering Trump s campaign promise was to  drain the swamp,  vowing to cleanse the government of corruption. [Trump s Cabinet] were people, we d been told, who were sacrificing lucrative private-sector posts to work in the service of the American people,  Nazaryan writes in the article.  Now, those very same  forgotten Americans were paying for [Secretary of the Treasury Steven] Mnuchin, worth as much as $500 million, because he apparently didn t want to go through airport security. Power and stupidity are close companions,  says Zephyr Teachout, a law professor at Fordham University and author of Corruption in America: From Benjamin Franklin s Snuff Box to Citizens United.  They are actually living in a world in which they can t see the ways in which they are being corrupted. You re so powerful that you don t even understand that a chartered flight isn t a right.

 Alabama Republican Just Defended Pedophilia Using The Bible,"The Washington Post just came out with an explosive report about the extremist candidate that Alabama is running for the United States Senate, Roy Moore. This is a man who has said that homosexuality should be illegal, got removed from the Alabama Supreme Court twice for defying the United States Supreme Court   once over a giant monument of the Ten Commandments he refused to remove from the courthouse, and once for defying the Obergefell v. Hodges ruling that legalized same-sex marriage   and has always made incendiary and bigoted statements that are out of the mainstream even for the Republican Party. Now, it has come out that Moore molested a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30 s.Now, one would think that this would be a bridge too far for anyone   especially the types of people who make entire political careers out of trying to legislate what goes on in other people s bedrooms on the basis of their twisted version of  morality,  but no. At least one Alabama Republican is defending Moore s actions, and he is using the Bible to do it. Alabama State Auditor Jim Ziegler says of what Moore allegedly did:Take the Bible. Zachariah and Elizabeth for instance. Zachariah was extremely old to marry Elizabeth and they became the parents of John the Baptist. Also take Joseph and Mary. Mary was a teenager and Joseph was an adult carpenter. They became parents of Jesus. So, let me get this straight. This guy is saying that what Moore did is A-okay because Jesus. This is insane, even for Republicans. Newsflash, Mr. Ziegler: Roy Moore is no Joseph from the Bible, and that young girl is no Mary. Further, it is absolutely absurd to suggest that a myth from a 2,000 year old holy text is some kind of justification for modern day pedophilia.I swear, these people will do anything to win. Then again, they elected Trump, so all bets are off these days. Here s yet another reason to make sure we take back Congress in 2018, Democrats. Let s bring some decency back to Washington.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News
 GOP Senate Candidate Turns Out To Be A Disgusting Child Molester,"The Republican favorite in Alabama s Senate race next month is being accused of inappropriate sexual conduct with a 14-year-old girl in 1979, The Washington Post reports. It s not just one child that the uber-Conservative Christian is accused of approaching when he was in his 30s, but the newspaper also found three other women who said that Roy Moore had approached them around a similar time when they were between the ages of 16 and 18.Leigh Corfman says she was 14 years old when Moore, then 32-years-old, approached her outside a courtroom in Etowah County, Ala. At that time, Moore was an assistant district attorney. Corfman s mother went inside for a child custody hearing after Moore offered to watch her daughter. He said,  Oh, you don t want her to go in there and hear all that. I ll stay out here with her,    says Corfman s mother, Nancy Wells, 71.  I thought, how nice for him to want to take care of my little girl. Once he was alone with Corfman, Moore asked for her phone number. It was days later that he picked her up around the corner from her house, drove her about 30 minutes to his home in the woods, then flattered her by telling her how pretty she was and kissed her. But by the second visit, things turned even worse when he took off the 14-year-old s shirt and pants and removed his clothes. Moore then allegedly touched her over her bra and underpants and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear, according to the paper. I wanted it over with   I wanted out,  she recalled thinking at the time.  Please just get this over with. Whatever this is, just get it over. Two of Corfman s childhood friends explained that she told them that she was seeing an older man, and one said that Corfman identified the man as Roy Moore.Corfman s mother said that her daughter told her about the encounter more than a decade later, during the time that Moore was becoming more prominent as a local judge.The Post spoke with three other women who said that Moore pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18 and he was in his early 30s. All three of the women the paper spoke to said that they never had any sexual contact with Moore outside of kissing. According to one woman who was 18-years-old and in high school at the time, Moore would bring bottles of wine to their dates, even though the legal drinking age was 19.One woman, Wendy Miller, said that she first met Moore when she was a 14-year-old working as  Santa s helper  at a mall. He began asking her out when she was 16 years old.But, conservatives will overlook Moore trying to diddle children.This is such a sad, punk move from Breitbart, and people are going to remember it. pic.twitter.com/V8tndfAeCD  Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) November 9, 2017Conservatives voted an admitted sexual predator into the highest office in the land, so Moore might get more votes following this explosive report.

 Senate Democrats Have Been Sneaking Around Behind GOPâ€™s Back To Unravel Trump Administration,"For the last several months, liberals have been watching the news with frustration over Congress  apparent Keystone Cop incompetency in its investigation of the Trump administration ties to Russia. The Senate has been somewhat better than the House, but still, we are pinning most of our hopes on special counsel Robert Mueller, until now.In a bombshell report in the Daily Beast, it was revealed that Senate Democrats are going behind the backs of Republicans and running their own investigation.According to the report, Senate Democrats on the Foreign Relations Committee have been secretly investigating the Trump/Russia connections with hope of making them public soon:Sean Bartlett, a Democratic spokesman for the committee, called the report a  major  effort to expose how Vladimir Putin s government has kept  the Russian public supportive of wars abroad, while distracted from the regime s criminality and corruption at home, and how, over the past decade-plus, it has adapted that toolkit and taken it global.  The report, he added,  describes how these efforts are led by the government s security services and buttressed by state-owned enterprises, Kremlin-aligned oligarchs, and Russian criminal groups that have effectively been nationalized by the state.  It traces how the operations  emanate out of Russia in concentric geographic circles: they began in Russia, expanded to its periphery and former satellites, and then into the rest of Europe and eventually, the United States. It s not completely secret. According to the committee s chairman, Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), they know about the investigation, but they have no idea what the Democrats have found. The Democrats would like Republicans to get on board, though.The investigation isn t just about Trump. It s broader, and it explores all of Russia s sins dating back years. They are investigating issues as varied as cheating in the Olympics and Russia s attacks on Soviet Bloc countries, including its illegal annexation of Crimea.That doesn t mean they aren t investigating Trump. As one member of a Republican think tank said: It s not about Trump, but the impact will be:  Hey Mr. President, here s a list of 55 sins of the Russians, and you re kissing Putin s ass   what s the deal?' Yeah, Republicans are scared, and so, I m sure, is Trump.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images.",News
 Sundayâ€™s Massacre In Texas Bumped Columbine Out Of The Top Ten Deadliest US Mass Shootings,"It s been more than 18 years, but anyone who was alive at the time will remember when they first heard the news that Eric David Harris, 18, and Dylan Bennet Klebold, 17, two students from Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, had shot and killed 12 of their fellow students, plus one teacher and wounded 21 additional people, before turning their guns on themselves in the school s library on that fateful morning of April 20, 1999. The pair were also packing almost 100 explosives in what USA Today described as a  suicidal attack [that was] planned as a grand if badly implemented terrorist bombing. At the time it was almost impossible to conceive a greater tragedy, two lonely teenage outcasts feeling the need to take so many innocent young lives on just a regular day at school. Sure, there had been other mass-shootings of a greater scale, but Columbine is still the worst US high school shooting on record, was the second-worst mass-shooting on any school campus at the time behind the 1966 University of Texas massacre, and the fifth-worst mass-shooting on US soil.Fast-forward less than two decades later and the murder spree at Columbine High School no longer even cracks the top-10 when it comes to the worst single-day mass-shootings in modern US history. What makes the statistics even more terrifying is that the five worst mass-shootings in the United States and six of the top-10, have all occurred in the last 10 years. To make matters worse, three of the top-5 were in the past 18 months.Here are the 10 worst single-day mass-shootings in modern US history, counting victims only. In each instance, the shooter s death has been omitted.Which brings us to Eric Harris, Dylan Klebold, and the Columbine High School massacre. To many, that is one of the worst tragedies the human mind can conjure up   Just a couple of misunderstood teenagers who sought the justice of who they saw as their transgressors by running riot on their school and shooting at anyone in their path, resulting in 13 deaths, before killing themselves. This incident is no longer one of the 10 worst mass-shootings in modern US history, but something needs to be done before it drops any lower.Featured image via screenshot",News

" Maine Voters Tell Trump To Go F*ck Himself, Expand Medicaid Through Obamacare","Republicans should be downright afraid to try killing Obamacare ever again.As we all know, Donald Trump has been urging Republicans in Congress to pass legislation that would strip healthcare from over 20 million Americans.Not only do Trump and his Republican allies want to kill Obamacare, they want to end Medicaid as we know it. Indeed, Medicaid would become a death panel where the state would decide what kind of healthcare people get.As Trump s effort to kill Obamacare gets more desperate, the landmark healthcare program gets more popular, enough so, that a few Republicans have broken ranks to oppose repeal.In fact, Medicaid expansion is so popular that Maine voters overruled Governor Paul LePage s veto on Tuesday via the ballot.According to Reuters,Tuesday s ballot asked Maine voters to approve or reject a plan to provide healthcare coverageunder Medicaid for adults under the age of 65 with incomes at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2017 is about $16,000 for a single person and about $22,000 for a family of two.And 60 percent of Maine voters approved, clearly rejecting LePage s and Trump s efforts to kill Medicaid and Obamacare.70,000 Mainers will now be eligible for Medicaid coverage and will get the healthcare they need and deserve.This is huge because Maine is often considered politically independent to conservative leaning, meaning that Republicans would be better off abandoning their war on healthcare.If they don t, voters across the country will go to the ballot box and replace them with lawmakers who actually give a damn about them and their health.And Trump could be on the path to being a one-term president, assuming he isn t impeached or arrested before 2020.And he ll have no one to blame but himself. Because people don t like it when politicians try to kill them.Featured Image: White House Photo by Pete Souza",News

Don t forget, Republicans won 4 out of 4 House seats, and with the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before!  Donald J.

And that was what doomed him.Rick Santorum came to Gillespie s defense in response to Trump s tweet. It s not Ed s fault, Santorum began.  You re blaming it on Ed, and I just don t think it s Ed s fault. I think the bottom line is Donald Trump is not delivering on what he said he was going to deliver on, and that s the problem. And he needs to deliver, and if there s a message for Republicans they better get that message and they better start passing stuff and looking like they can govern. Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump has never taken responsibility for anything in his entire life.

He s weak on crime, weak on our GREAT VETS, Anti-Second Amendment .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2017 .and has been horrible on Virginia economy. Vote @EdWGillespie today!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2017.@EdWGillespie will totally turn around the high crime and poor economic performance of VA. MS-13 and crime will be gone. Vote today, ASAP!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2017Yet, Trump threw Gillespie under the bus after hearing about the defeat.Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for. Don t forget, Republicans won 4 out of 4 House seats, and with the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2017Seriously.You can bet that if Gillespie had won Trump would kissing his ass right now and calling him a close friend and loyal supporter. But he lost so Trump is trashing him and pretending that he never really supported him.Trump also lied because not only did Gillespie embrace Trump and his bigotry, the economy is only hitting record numbers thanks to the policies of President Obama. Had Obama served a ninth year in office, we would be seeing these same economic numbers. Because Trump is still operating on the Obama budget and has not signed a single piece of economic legislation.If this election is a sign of things to come, Trump and the Republican Party should be scared to death. The American people are coming for them and it s not going to be pretty.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News
 The Resistance Just Gave Trump A Huge F**CK YOU On Election Night,"Tuesday was a big election night for an off-year election. This was especially true for Democrats. It was a true test of the power of The Resistance, because despite Donald Trump s awfulness, initially we lost five straight special elections for Congressional seats vacated by people who went to work in Cabinet positions in the Trump Administration. Therefore, it was a HUGE relief as the election results rolled in on Tuesday night.The Democrats gained a governorship, as Democrat Phil Murphy roundly thumped Republican and LT. Governor and ally to outgoing Governor Chris Christie Kim Guadagno, and Democrat Ralph Northam beat Republican Ed Gillespie in Virginia. Despite the fact that Gillespie ran a positively Trumpian campaign, full of racism and anti-immigrant fear-mongering, it didn t work. Gillespie is not Teflon Don. Also, Danica Roem made history by becoming the first transgender person to be elected to the Virginia House of Delegates. The icing on the cake here is that she beat incumbent Robert G. Marshall, who is a proud homophobe who regularly peddled so-called  bathroom bills.  After twenty-six years, the very embodiment of everything this man hates has pushed him from public office.Further, of course liberal New York City re-elected Mayor Bill de Blasio, who won in a landslide. This is the first time the Democrats have swept all three big off-year races   New York Mayor, New Jersey Governor, and Virginia Governor   since 1989.Dems have won all three of the marquee off-year races   NJGov, VAGov, NYC Mayor   for the first time since 1989.  Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) November 8, 2017Tuesday night was a round rejection of the bigotry and divisiveness that has characterized everything about Donald Trump, the campaign he ran, and his entire administration   from his racist Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, to his bigoted Vice President Mike Pence, to the white nationalists that have paraded in and out of Trump s adult daycare center White House. All in all, it s a great night for the Resistance. But remember   celebrate tonight, get back to work tomorrow. 2018 is just around the corner.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News
 Trumpâ€™s Justice Dept. Realizes Prosecuting Woman For Laughing Is Stupid â€“ Drops Case Entirely,"Trump s Department of Justice has finally figured out they re stupid in one instance, at least. Back in January, a member of Code Pink named Desiree Fairooz laughed during Jeff Sessions  confirmation hearing, was charged with disorderly conduct, found guilty, and faced up to a full year in prison for it. A D.C. court tossed out her conviction and set a new trial, but now the DOJ has dropped the case entirely:Here s the Justice Department s notice it s dropping charges against woman who laughed at Jeff Sessions during his confirmation hearing. pic.twitter.com/Dv5vqzxdPA  Dominic Holden (@dominicholden) November 7, 2017Fairooz  own reaction to the news says it all about the stupidity of this endeavor:Just received this,  Governments Notice of Nolle Prosequi  What a relief! Guess they ve got enough  laughing  matters to deal with!  Desiree Fairooz (@desireefairooz) November 6, 2017She laughed because she felt Senator Shelby s overly-syrupy remarks about Sessions alleged record of treating everyone equally were as ridiculous as they sound. Sessions treats people anything but equally and he has a long track record of that. Code Pink s campaign director said Fairooz  laughter was a reflex action more than anything, which actually does make a lot of sense. Fairooz herself didn t mean to actually laugh, but she did say: I felt it was my responsibility as a citizen to dissent at the confirmation hearing of Senator Jeff Sessions, a man who professes anti-immigrant, anti-LGBT policies, who has voted against several civil rights measures and who jokes about the white supremacist terrorist group the Ku Klux Klan. That s the whole problem, though: The Trump administration doesn t want dissent. And while it s true that Fairooz had several prior arrests for protesting, the number of cases publicly brought against dissenters of this administration is absolutely astonishing. This is a victory for all who stand for what s right which is the opposite of what Trump s administration stands for.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News

 Trump Just Openly Called For A Third World War (VIDEO),"You know all those fears conservatives dismiss that Trump is going to get us into another world war? Well, those concerns are very real based on what he just said at a press conference in Seoul, South Korea. It s time to act with urgency and with great determination,  Trump said during the press conference.  North Korea is a worldwide threat that requires worldwide action. We call on every responsible nation including China and Russia to demand that the North Korean regime end its nuclear weapons and its missile programs,  The Donald said. The United States stands prepared to defend itself and its allies using the full range of our unmatched military capabilities if need be,  Trump said, desperately trying to  wag the dog  in an effort to distract from the mounting criminal indictments of his associates.Is it any wonder that seemingly more South Koreans showed up to protest Trump than Americans attended his inauguration? Trump is getting desperate, and it seems that he has decided a war is the way to go if he wants to escape from the situation he has put himself in unscathed.Watch Trump tell the world he ll kill us all to distract from his bullsh*t below:US President Trump: North Korea is a worldwide threat that requires worldwide action https://t.co/EQixZGcdRR pic.twitter.com/z6BToFOUQP  CNN International (@cnni) November 7, 2017Featured image via screengrab",News

Donald Trump, the man who has literally spent every moment of his adult life milking his own country and continues to do so now from the Oval Office, agrees that people who do what he does should be treated harshly.Trump and his administration are currently under investigation for colluding with a foreign state to undermine our democratic process. Trump is also a tax evader and has made deals with some very shady people including people with mob and terrorist connections.In fact, Trump s own tax plan would especially benefit him and his family. And he has placed his own family members in high White House positions, all while using the executive branch to promote his businesses, all of which violates ethics rules.Some Twitter users pointed out the irony and hypocrisy of Trump s tweet.Like your team is doing??? pic.twitter.com/51L89Rrnfs  sweetsallysue (@sweetsallysue) November 7, 2017RELEASE YOUR TAXES and we'll see who has been ""milking"" their country for years! #PutinsPuppet #FakePresident  RandeMande (@almondleafer) November 7, 2017Like you have been milking US for years? #Traitor  Reap what you sow (@2017moderate) November 7, 2017That is a hilarious statement coming from you, that's exactly what you are doing to us.  jbarton (@jlbarton618) November 6, 2017Make no mistake, Trump has milked the United States more than anyone and he intends to milk much more out of taxpayers unless he is removed from office and put in prison where he belongs.Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News
" Miss Texas Gave A VERY Unexpected Answer When Asked About Trump, And Republicans Are Furious","Long before Cara Mund,  Miss North Dakota,  won the 2018 Miss America pageant, she faced a crowd of 50 other young women, all competing in various categories for the coveted crown. Two of those categories, to most of our readers, are patriarchal and silly: The evening wear and swimwear  competitions  pit all these beautiful young women against one another for assessment on their looks by a panel of judges.The other two categories, however, can be quite interesting, especially when something happens like what went down with Miss Texas in this year s competition.The talent portion of the show is, of course, just plain entertaining. Perhaps you ve seen the movie Miss Congeniality, starring Sandra Bullock, and if you have, you know what I m hoping to see in a talent show. The real thing is very little like that, however, and so is the interview portion of Miss America. Source: Meme Central, a folder on my computerTonight, Miss Texas was no Miss Rhode Island. There were two rounds of questions this time around, and when Margana Wood was called on for the second, more serious question, she got a doozy. Drawing a judge s name from a dish, she pulled Jess Cagle, the editor-in-chief of People Magazine. Cagle wasted zero time getting right to it: Last month, a demonstration of neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and the KKK in Charlottesville, Virginia turned violent and a counter-protester was killed. The president said there was shared blame with, quote,  very fine people on both sides.  Were there? Tell me yes or no, and explain. Well, then. That s a far cry from every participant simply answering  World Peace!  whenever their turn came around to say the one thing to the world they had in their heart. Ms. Wood was not, as they say, f*cking around. Barely containing her anger, Margana turned it up to 11: I think that the white supremacist issue, it was very obvious that it was a terrorist attack. And I think that president Donald Trump should have made a statement on it earlier, addressing the fact, and making sure all Americans feel safe in this country. That is the number one issue right now. Naturally, Republicans were butthurt.

 Trump Is Trying To Make Facebook Give Him Personal Info Of People Who Criticize Him,"Lawyers for the Trump administration have served Facebook with three separate search warrants, demanding the private account information of users who could be described in their words as  anti-administration activists who have spoken out at organized events, and who are generally very critical of this administration s policies.  Read: Trump critics, and this has the potential to affect thousands of Facebook users.Fortunately, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion to quash the warrants on Thursday on behalf of three Facebook users. What is particularly chilling about these warrants is that anti-administration political activists are going to have their political associations and views scrutinized by the very administration they are protesting,  said ACLU attorney Scott Michelman.One such user is Emmelia Talarico. Talarico operated the disruptj20 page where other users could discuss and organize protests for Trump s Inauguration Day. If the search warrants are passed and Facebook is required to hand over the information, the government would have access to the identities of the estimated 6,000 users who visited the page. Talarico says if her account information were given to the government, officials would have access to her  personal passwords, security questions and answers, and credit card information,  plus  the private lists of invitees and attendees to multiple political events sponsored by the page. Facebook was first served the warrants back in February and they came with a gag order preventing the social media giant from alerting the three users in question about the government seeking their personal information. Michelman claims that government attorneys dropped the gag order earlier this month, allowing Facebook to expose the existence of the warrants, however, all court filings and any response from Facebook are still deemed confidential.The warrants also seek the personal information from the accounts of Lacy MacAuley and Legba Carrefour. Carrefour, a self-described political activist, acknowledges that he has participated in or helped to organize dozens of demonstrations and events of various types in service of political causes,  but is also concerned about the warrants because his Facebook account  contains a significant amount of private material concerning my personal life.

 Multiple Witnesses Confirm: The Pee Pee Tapes Are Real,"Remember the fabled pee pee tapes? Well, it seems that we have a little bit more info on them   including that Donald Trump s staff was seen arguing with hotel security  about whether or not a couple of prostitutes would be allowed in his hotel room during a stay in Russia.In his infamous dossier, former British spy Michael Steele alleged that Trump had paid prostitutes to come up to his room and urinate on one another on a bed that Barack and Michelle Obama once shared. Steele claimed at the time that the incident was filmed and would be used by the Kremlin as  kompromat  (compromising material).Award-winning British journalist Paul Wood reports for The Spectator that not only do multiple witnesses confirm the pee pee tape, but there are more extreme recordings of Donald Trump than just a couple of Russian girls urinating:I heard of Russian kompromat  compromising material   on Trump from two sources months before the Steele dossier came to light.There are, though, reports of witnesses in the hotel who corroborate Steele s reporting. These include an American who s said to have seen a row with the hotel security over whether the hookers would be allowed up to Trump s suite. The dossier s account of hookers in a Moscow hotel room was the subject of gossip among politicians and intelligence people for months before it was published. Now claims are circulating of more tapes showing more extreme behavior. Expect these allegations to emerge in due course,  Wood says cryptically.Will the pee pee tapes finally surface? Who knows   but Trump must be sweating his fake tanner off thinking about it.Featured image via Getty Images",News
" Fox News Just Completed Transformation Into Safe Space For Fragile, Snowflakey Donald Trump","Fox News has decided to cancel certain ads on their network, completing their transition from a conservative network into a safe space for their fragile Trump fans, and after Trump himself threw a livid fit. A series of ads by political activist Tom Steyer, which call for Trump s impeachment, has been pulled because of the reaction to it from their viewers. Seriously: Due to the strong negative reaction to their ad by our viewers, we could not in good conscience take their money. Why, because their viewers will abandon the network if they show any signs of trying to be balanced? Of course, Fox News is a private entity and is allowed to do this, but the question remains: Is it censorship if they did so because of pressure from Trump? The unhinged presidential impostor did go on Twitter to call Steyer  wacky & totally unhinged  when the  Impeach Trump  campaign was first launched in late October. That may well have put pressure on Fox to pull it.Wacky & totally unhinged Tom Steyer, who has been fighting me and my Make America Great Again agenda from beginning, never wins elections!  Donald J.

Or, at the very least, terrified that he ll stop coming for ridiculously easy and softball interviews from friendly neighborhood conspiracy theorists like Sean Hannity.Steyer, for his part, is claiming that Fox is in breach of contract over this. His lawyer, Brad Deutsch, said that, on Oct. 27, Fox had agreed unconditionally to air the ads for one more week. Canceling the ads when they did  signaled a profound failure of journalistic integrity, a suppression of constitutionally protected speech, and likely a consequence of inexcusable political pressure.

 Trump Tells Japanese Diplomats He Never Knew There Were So Many Countries In The World,"Who knew that presidenting would be so hard, right? Conservatives voted a former reality show star into power with zero experience in politics and they thought that would be a good thing. Donald Trump has always claimed to have a high IQ, even going as far as to offer to compare IQ tests with Rex Tillerson after reports surfaced that the secretary of State had called him a  fucking moron.  But we d really like that to happen because while Trump is on his 13-day trip overseas, he revealed to Japanese dignitaries that he didn t know how many countries there are in the world until he became the so-called president.First, Japanese Prime Minister Abe gave his remarks in front of the crowded room, then Trump got up to the mic to be sure to embarrass the U.S.   again. So my relationship with Shinzo got off to quite a rocky start because I never ran for office, and here I am,  Trump told the room.  But I never ran, so I wasn t very experienced. And after I had won, everybody was calling me from all over the world. I never knew we had so many countries. Trump kicked off his remarks by calling Prime Minister Abe by his first name.Trump s remarks start around the 14- minute mark:It s kind of an important thing to know, don t you think? Especially if you re supposed to be the leader of the free world.For the record, there are 193 UN member states, plus the State of Palestine and the Holy See (Vatican), both of which are non-member observers of the UN. So really, there are 195 countries in the world. South Sudan was added to the list in 2011.Hey, and I m not even the president! But I do know how to Google. We re sure Barron Trump could do that for his father since he s obviously not capable of looking up important information.Featured image via video screen capture  ",News
 Latest From Conservatives: God Was Answering Victimsâ€™ Prayers By Letting Them Get Shot,"We are 308 days into 2017, and so far there have been 378 mass shootings   most done by angry white men with too many guns and with domestic violence issues. It s difficult to spin that fact in any way that doesn t spit in the face of our nation s gun lust, but conservatives try. One even says it s a good thing.Donald Trump called it a mental health issue, one that has no proposed solutions, just days after he called for a complete policy change after an ISIS connected terrorist plowed into people in New York.Even Trump s tone-deaf reaction seemed compassionate compared to a conservative blogger and Lutheran pastor who says that God was answering the victims  prayers by taking them to heaven.Hans Fiene wrote his column in The Federalist in response to liberals who say that thoughts and prayers are not enough to quell the mass shooting epidemic. God wanted them dead, he said, and that s what prayer is all about.When we pray these words, we are certainly praying that God would deliver us from evil temporally that is, in this earthly life. Through these words, we are asking God to send his holy angels to guard us from those who would seek to destroy us with knives and bombs and bullets. It may seem, on the surface, that God was refusing to give such protection to his Texan children. But we are also praying that God would deliver us from evil eternally. Through these same words, we are asking God to deliver us out of this evil world and into his heavenly glory, where no violence, persecution, cruelty, or hatred will ever afflict us again. Just like those who put Christ to death, and just like those who have brought violence to believers in every generation, this man only succeeded in being the means through which God delivered his children from this evil world into an eternity of righteousness and peace. Perhaps instead of eternal damnation, the shooter who murdered 26 parishioners should receive sainthood.Featured image via Facebook.",News
 University Of Texas Police Kick Humiliated Nazis Off Campus Before They Could Start Trouble,"This is how police should deal with Nazis and white supremacists.The tiki torches were doused early at the University of Texas on Friday night after campus police quickly chased the group of racists off the premises.They were attempting to invade the campus and hold a rally on the Main Mall, which likely would have included Nazi chants and waving Confederate and Nazi flags.But police put a stop to it before the rally could even begin.After police informed the public of the service provided, university president Gregory Fenves released a statement strongly condemning white supremacy. The actions of white supremacists and other hate groups are completely anathema to UT s values, and I abhor what they represent,  Fenves said.  These are difficult times for our nation, with movements fueled by hatred increasingly taking root, as we saw in Charlottesville and elsewhere. We must continue to denounce these ugly, un-American ideas in the strongest terms. The actions of a hate group do not define us. They never will. White supremacists and Nazis have been emboldened since Donald Trump refused to condemn them in response to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia earlier this year. Instead, Trump blamed  both sides  and claimed that a lot of Nazis are  fine people.

 Russian Lawyer Drops Bomb On Donald Trump Jr.; Alleges Direct Pay-To-Play Attempt,"For the first time in my adult life, I m happy with the fact that Christmas started in October. Last Monday, Special Investigator Robert Mueller indicted two people closely connected to the Donald Trump campaign and he revealed that a third had taken a deal. Now there s an allegation that hits directly at Trump and his family and it s a big one.Still, for Trump, there is plausible deniability. Paul Manafort was  only  Trump s campaign chairman for a few months. Before last Monday, few outside of Washington had heard of Manafort s business partner Rick Gates. And well, George Popadopoulos was just a glorified  coffee boy  who happened to have very close connections to the Trump administration and to Russia.Not buying those defenses? Well, most Trumpsters do, but even the most hardcore Trump supporter would have a hard time denying this Trump-Russia connection. According to the lawyer that Donald Jr. met with, in the meeting that promised dirt on Hillary Clinton, Jr. offered up the play to her pay, or perhaps the other way around. He allegedly told her that in exchange for the damning info that never materialized, the Trump administration would look at easing sanctions against Russia.For her part, (Kremlin linked lawyer Natalia) Veselnitskaya said the meeting had commenced with high hopes. She began by raising the issue of the Obama-era sanctions against the Russians, known as the Magnitsky Act. With the hint that Veselnitskaya would provide dirt on Clinton, Trump Jr. promised to revisit the sanctions. Looking ahead, if we come to power, we can return to this issue and think what to do about it,  Trump Jr. told Veselnitskaya.  I understand our side may have messed up, but it ll take a long time to get to the bottom of it. Source: NewsweekVeselnitskaya didn t actually have any information for Jr., at least not during that meeting, but the intent was pretty clear. And while it s true that intent, even if proven, is not quite the smoking gun Mueller is looking for, Trump Sr. s actions give special emphasis to this alleged promise. Trump reluctantly signed a bill increasing sanctions against Russia and he s refusing to enforce it.In the wake of the indictments and of impending indictments, the fact that Veselnitskaya is willing to testify should have Trump Jr. (and Sr.) shaking in his $1,000 boots.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images.",News
 WATCH: Republican Lawmaker Claims Forcing Women To Have Babies Will Help The Economy,"This maniac wants  The Handmaid s Tale  to become reality.Abortion is protected by the constitution in this country. But a Wisconsin lawmaker thinks that women should be forced to get pregnant and give birth.Wisconsin state GOP Rep. Scott Allen made the horrendous remarks while criticizing a bill that would block state employees from covering abortion with their health insurance.Because he doesn t think the bill goes far enough.Seriously.Allen pitched his idea to force women to give birth, and tried to justify his idea by claiming that forcing women to give birth will somehow help the economy. Labor force shortages are tied to population declines. Labor force shortages are a limiting factor in economic growth. Limited economic growth poses a problem when government tries to pay for public services and infrastructure. In spite of this Mr. Speaker, ironically, the Democrats continue their efforts to support the abortion industry. See what he did there? Allen claims that forcing women to give birth against their will is good for the economy. I m sure he would say the same thing about slavery, too.Here s the video via Twitter.Your #saturdaymorning WTF:WI Rep. Scott Allen says women should be made to give birth for the good of the economy.?pic.twitter.com/db01mkLQMl  Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) November 4, 2017Allen is, of course, wrong. The fact is that there are millions of Americans who are currently unemployed. There are more people in this country than there are jobs. More people will not solve the economic problems we face today. And if women are forced to have babies, it will only make the problem worse, especially among teens. Teen girls who get pregnant and have babies are at an economic disadvantage. Many are forced to drop out of school and forgo college, making it more difficult for them to get high-paying jobs.The lack of child care services in this country also makes it difficult for women to work and take care of their children at the same time.The cost of raising children is incredibly expensive now, and most people are struggling to get by as it is. More kids will just add more struggle and stress. This country has a sufficient labor force. The problem is that businesses would rather hire what amounts to slave laborers overseas. Wages are also too low, which prevents most people from sparking economic growth through spending. If all workers can do with the little money they get is pay bills, it leaves very little left to spend at area businesses.In the end, forcing women to have kids is unconstitutional and will do nothing to grow the economy. Forcing big business to pay worker a livable wage, however, will turn the economy into the powerhouse it once was.Featured Image: Screenshot",News
 Someone Tried To Cash In On Antifa With These $375 Jackets And Twitter Had A Field Day,"History has shown that one of the most cost-effective ways to project your dissatisfaction when attending a large organized protest is to go to an army surplus shop, buy a cheap M-65 field jacket for around $25 and some sharpies. Not only will the jacket keep you warm during the colder months, you can customize it to get the exact message you want across, all the while having that badass Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver vibe about you.The only problem with that approach is that customizing the jacket takes a combination of effort and creativity and not all of us have the time or the skills to pull it off   some of us are just too lazy. Fortunately for those who fit into either of those demographics, Barneys New York are now stocking the Alpha Industries  Anarchy  jacket for am extortionate outlay of $375. Sure, it may be kind of generic and not express exactly what is on your mind, but the general sentiment is there, I guess.So, what do you get for $375? As the Barneys website describes it, the  Alpha Industries  M-65 field jacket is constructed of olive cotton-blend canvas. This military-inspired piece is detailed with assorted handwritten graffiti, a checked pattern pocket, and anarchy symbols at the front and back. Alpha Industries were initially a contractor for the US Military and according to Angelyn Fernandez, their VP of Product, self-expression was the inspiration behind this piece. We have seen resistance to power and authority become a trend in our current pop culture and society, often expressed through fashion,  she said.  Since 1965 the M-65 field jackets have been a favored method to graphically express one s opinion. We developed the Barneys M-65 anarchy jacket to encompass the artistic and graphic expressions of individuality. There were just two major flaws in Ms. Fernadez s plan, the first being that the statements on the jacket can t really be deemed an  expression of individuality  if they are mass produced and sold for an enormous profit. The second is that the key demographic for whom she was aiming generally tend to shun capitalism. Those exact people, however, have embraced social media and many took to Twitter to show their lack of appreciation for the piece, many to hilarious effect.*swipes platinum Amex card *""Welcome to the resistance""  panamaorange (@panamaorange) November 3, 2017FIGHT THE POWER!

 Senator Delivers SCATHING Rebuke To His GOP Colleagues â€“ â€˜No One Is Safeâ€™ Because Of You,"It s been a tragic, but infuriating day for America. In the wake of the mass shooting at a church in Texas, we ve all heard the obligatory  thoughts and prayers  and  May God be with yous,  we ve come to expect from Republicans who are more concerned about their NRA ratings than they are about actual lives. So Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut blasted them for it in his official statement on the shooting.In it, he asks a very, very important question: How can you claim that you respect human life while choosing fealty to weapons-makers over support for measures favored by the vast majority of your constituents? This is something he wants each of his Republican colleagues to consider seriously as they go to sleep tonight, because many of these people (like Ted Cruz and Paul Ryan) claim to value human life in the abortion debate, but behave as though the deaths of thousands of people already here on this Earth due to gun violence is simply the price of freedom. That s not valuing life. That s valuing the money they get from various lobbies.Murphy went on to state his heartbreak, not just over high-profile mass shootings, but others as well: My heart breaks for Sutherland Springs. Just like it still does for Las Vegas. And Orlando. And Charleston. And Aurora. And Blacksburg. And Newtown. Just like it does every night for Chicago. And New Orleans. And Baltimore. And Bridgeport. Then he ended it with quite possibly the most powerful statement there is: The terrifying fact is that no one is safe so long as Congress chooses to do absolutely nothing in the face of this epidemic. The time is now for Congress to shed its cowardly cover and do something. Congress continually fails to act because Republicans won t. So while Murphy diplomatically says that we aren t safe because Congress is too cowardly to act, he s laying the blame for this squarely at his Republican colleagues  feet. The saddest part is that the GOP won t heed this. The gun lobby will have to be shut down one way or another for Republicans to open their eyes to reality. You can read his full statement below:Whoa, this statement from @ChrisMurphyCT on the Sutherland Springs, Texas shooting is extremely powerful. Wow. pic.twitter.com/4qyP3sH9co  Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) November 5, 2017Featured image via Erich Schlegel/Getty Images",News
 A Reminder Of How Much The NRA Has Spent On Trump In Wake Of ANOTHER Mass Shooting,"At least 27 people, including children, were murdered at a mostly-white church in Texas this morning, and we re already hearing  thoughts, prayers, and may God be with them,  from all the people who get millions in support from the NRA. Trump himself tweeted,  May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas.  He added that law enforcement was on the scene and he was  monitoring the situation from Japan. However, it s extremely unlikely we ll hear calls from him about reviewing our incredibly lax gun laws anytime soon like he ranted about needing tighter immigration controls following the terrorist attack in New York City. And here s a possible reason why: The NRA spent tens of millions getting Trump elected.In 2016, the NRA s total support for Trump was over $30 million. The next highest spending amount was for Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina with a paltry $6.3 million.Source: Opensecrets.orgTrump is very easily bought, and he also rewards those who show him their undying loyalty. That s evidenced by every one of his cabinet picks. His promises to  drain the swamp  disappeared as soon as he was able to start rewarding his most loyal subjects.By contrast, those who haven t shown sufficient loyalty are attacked, dragged through the mud, and sometimes even fired. Trump can t fire the NRA, but even if he could, he wouldn t because they re essentially giving each other mutual blow jobs here. In fact, one of the first bills Trump signed into law was one that made it easier for people who are mentally incapable of caring for themselves get guns. He also returned their favor by appearing at their annual conference   something no president had done since Ronald Reagan. He s even said,  You came through for me, and I am going to come through for you. So can we really expect Trump to call for a review of our impossibly lax gun laws? No. Because then the NRA spend their millions on someone else.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News
" 27 People Murdered In Texas Mass Shooting, And Trumpâ€™s Response Is Classic Racist","Every other day there seems to be a new mass shooting. It s barely over a month since the massacre in Las Vegas and we now have the deadliest mass shooting to take place in a house of worship. A gunman opened fire on a church in the tiny town of Sutherland, Texas, and at least 27 people are dead, including children and including the shooter.This is a developing story, but at the time of this posting law enforcement had not yet released information on the shooter other than the fact that he was killed. They also aren t reporting a possible motive   they say right now the shooter s motive is unclear. Regardless, Donald Trump has already responded to it on Twitter:May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs, Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 5, 2017That response is that of a classic racist, and here s why: As soon as we heard about the killing in New York City at the hands of someone shouting  Allahu Akbar,  Trump s first response was this:In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2017We must not allow ISIS to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere. Enough!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2017THEN he sent his condolences to New York City, and after he did that he went on another rant about Islamic terrorism:I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program.

If it turns out this was an angry white guy with a gun, like it was in Las Vegas and like it has been in multiple other mass shootings of this nature, we won t hear anything else except more  thoughts and prayers.  That s ironic considering these people were already in church and were presumably people of prayer.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News
 Trump Went To Japan And Immediately Proved He Knows Zilch About How Missiles Work,"Who knew that Donald Trump would humiliate himself and us as soon as humanly possible with his trip to Asia? There was really no way to know that   this is one of the smartest men on the planet oh wait. This is Donald Trump. And in discussing North Korea s decision to fire ballistic missiles over Japan, he wondered why Japan didn t just shoot those missiles down.That, in turn, shows a complete and total lack of knowledge about how missiles work, about even our own military s capabilities, and about the optics of such an endeavor on ours and Japan s part. First off, it would have been extremely difficult for Japan to shoot them down due to their altitude and speed. Japan does have missile interceptors, but North Korea s missiles were very likely out of range.Then there are the optics: Japan would have been embarrassed alongside us. Our own capabilities to shoot down missiles are also limited, and tests on both systems have failed consistently. Watching us and Japan embarrass ourselves would have emboldened North Korea because it would have told them that we can t stop their missiles. An emboldened North Korea is the last thing the world needs right now.But that s not all. Trump also insulted all of Japan by saying that he couldn t understand why a country full of samurai warriors wouldn t want to shoot down North Korea s missiles. While the samurai are a part of Japan s long and rich history, Trump calling them  a nation of samurai warriors  just reinforces the rest of the world s belief that Americans are too stupid and too arrogant to bother learning about anyone else, and would rather just fall back on ethnic stereotypes.These remarks took place well before Trump actually headed to Japan; however, the news of it came out as he was en route. So, just like every other international trip on which the walking racist presidential impostor has gone, we have been embarrassed on the world stage. Again.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images",News
 The Walls Close In On Trump As His Disgraced National Security Adviser Faces Indictment From Team Mueller,"Donald Trump s scandal-ridden, chaotic White House has recently been thrown into further disarray as people who worked on his campaign have faced indictments from Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team. His former Campaign Chair Paul Manafort was taken into federal custody this past Monday, as was Manafort s sidekick and Trump adviser Rick Gates. Foreign policy adviser George Padadopuolos pled guilty to charges he was facing, and is now cooperating with Mueller s team. Now, NBC News is reporting that disgraced former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn is under Mueller s gun as well, because there is now enough evidence to charge Flynn in this oh so hot investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.According to NBC News, Mueller is pressuring Flynn to cooperate, because there is a person near and dear to Flynn s heart who could be in trouble: His own son, Michael G. Flynn. The younger Michael Flynn worked on the campaign and the Trump transition team. If the elder Flynn cooperates with Team Mueller, he just might be able to save his son from hard prison time. Most parents would definitely be up for limiting the legal consequences of something this serious for their children. This is very bad news for the Trump White House, because Michael Flynn was very close to Donald Trump during the campaign and worked in the White House as National Security Adviser for 24 days. He clearly knows a lot, and if it means that sharing that information would keep his son out of federal prison, he ll likely be more than willing to share that information with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This is all very bad news for the Trump White House, but very good news for the country. The more people Mueller flips, the closer we are to removing this criminal administration.This is a developing story.

 Former Watergate Prosecutor: Mueller Could Gag Trump On Russia,"Donald Trump may think it s perfectly fine for him to say and tweet about anything and everything, including his outrage over the FBI s Russia investigation, but in truth, it s not. And Robert Mueller could actually do something about it if he feels the Complicit Orange One is interfering. Former Watergate prosecutor Nick Akerman said: This could be grounds for Mueller to obtain a gag order on Trump. It would be unprecedented, but he is interfering with the government s right to a fair trial. Akerman was responding to Trump s decision to blast George Papadopoulos, who tried to arrange meetings between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials (including between Putin and Trump), and is now working with the FBI as a cooperating witness. Trump called him a  low-level volunteer  who had  already proven to be a liar,  in his typically pathetic attempt to distance himself from those who are incriminating to him.He then repeated his calls for the Department of Justice to investigate Hillary Clinton, the Democrats, and basically anybody who isn t him or has anything to do with him. His calls for the DOJ to investigate people who ve pissed him off has drawn widespread criticism from legal professionals and analysts.The Fake President is also upset with the fact that he can t control what the DOJ does. He doesn t want an independent Justice Department   he wants a department that will go after who he tells them to go after: The saddest thing is, because I am the president of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department. I m not supposed to be involved with the FBI. I m not supposed to be doing the kind of things I would love to be doing and I am very frustrated by it.It s very discouraging to me. I ll be honest, I m very unhappy with it, that the Justice Department isn t going   maybe they are, but you know, as president   and I think you understand this   as a president you re not supposed to be involved in that process. He ll be even less happy under a gag order from Mueller. Too bad for him if Mueller actually decides to do it.Featured image via Alex Wong and Win McNamee/Getty Images",News
 GOP Lawmaker Links Abortion To The Economy In One Bizarre And Horribly Offensive Rant (VIDEO),"Republican lawmakers come up with the most ridiculous things to push their agendas. Take women s reproductive rights. They have all manner of reasons for why abortion should be illegal; from the misogynistic, religious and moral reasons all the way over to the misogynistic and outright bizarre ones. A lawmaker in Wisconsin just tossed himself into the  misogynistic and outright bizarre  corner with the most ridiculous and offensive idea out there: Labor force shortages are tied to population declines. Labor force shortages are a limiting factor in economic growth. And limited economic growth poses a problem when government tries to pay for public services and infrastructure. In spite of this Mr. Speaker, ironically, the Democrats continue their effort to support the abortion industry. Yes, he really did essentially say that women should be forced to give birth, even to children they can t care for, to ensure a strong labor force and thus, a stronger economy.Holy hell, this is right up there with the guy from Oklahoma who said that hormonal contraception litters women s uteruses with tiny, dead babies. How do people come up with this bullshit? And they manage to make it sound completely reasonable when they do it. Watch this guy try to sound all reasonable about it below:WOW. WI Rep.

 Trump Wants The Supreme Court To Punish Lawyers Who Win Cases Against His Administration,"This is yet another egregious abuse of power.If the Supreme Court caves in to Donald Trump s latest demands, it will truly be the end of the rule of law as we know it.Two weeks ago, a 17-year-old migrant (known as Jane Doe in court records) sought an abortion but was denied the procedure by the Trump Administration.The government forced her to remain in a refugee center in Texas rather than allow her to exercise a constitutional right.So the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) took the Trump Administration to court and asked the judge to grant their client the ability to seek the medical care she needed.To make a long story short, she won. And she won again when the Trump Administration appealed. The girl then went to a doctor and got an abortion.But, of course, this made the Trump Administration angry.Despite the fact that the girl legally received an abortion, Trump s Justice Department is throwing a temper tantrum because they think the girl should have informed them so that they could block her by appealing to a higher court. This was a total surprise. And we re disturbed about it,  disgraced Attorney General Jeff Sessions whined.Let s make this clear. The girl had the abortion following a ruling by a federal appeals court judge that granted her request to seek the procedure. She did not have to wait nor did she have to inform the government. It is the government s responsibility to file appeals quickly. But the Trump Administration did not file quick enough.And now the Trump Administration is demanding that the Supreme Court punish the ACLU lawyers for winning their case and helping their client get the abortion she wanted.According to the Tribune Washington Bureau,On Friday, new Solicitor General Noel Francisco filed an appeal that asks the Supreme Court to set aside the lower court s rulings and to consider  disciplinary action  against the ACLU.They  kept the government in the dark about when Ms. Doe was scheduled to have an abortion,  he told the justices.  Given the extraordinary circumstances  of the case, the court should consider sanctions against one or more of the ACLU lawyers, he said.Trump s Administration is stooping to a new low. The Supreme Court should not be used as a tool to punish or attack lawyers who help their clients win. The ACLU won their case twice and their client exercised her right to have an abortion in accordance with the court decision. They were not required to inform the federal government. That would have been a violation of their client s privacy. If the Trump Administration wanted to appeal, they should have done it much faster instead of expecting a teen girl and her lawyers to keep them informed about her every move.ACLU legal director David Cole reacted strongly to Trump s demand. This administration has gone to astounding lengths to block this young woman from getting an abortion. After the courts cleared the way for her to get her abortion, it was the ACLU s job as her lawyers to see that she wasn t delayed any further   not give the government another chance to stand in her way. Our lawyers acted in the best interest of our client and in full compliance with court orders and federal and Texas law. That government lawyers failed to seek judicial review quickly enough is their fault, not ours. If the conservative Justices on the Supreme Court go along with this demand, it will only further erode the credibility of the court and our justice system. And Trump would have a new weapon to use against anyone who opposes him in a court of law.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News
 Hypocrite Ivanka Trump HUMILIATED For Calling For End To Sexual Harassment While Predator Dad Is In Japan With Her,"This did NOT go well.In a nearly empty room of people on Friday at the World Assembly for Women in Japan, Ivanka Trump had the gall to talk about sexual harassment despite the fact that her own daddy has been accused of rape and sexual harassment by over a dozen women, not to mention the fact that he has openly treated women like shit over the years. All too often, our workplace culture fails to treat women with appropriate respect,  Trump said.  This takes all forms, including harassment, which can never be tolerated. Our workplaces must mirror our values: work and family.

" After Pulling NFL-Related Ads, Papa Johnâ€™s Gets An Unlikely Sponsor Of Their Own: Nazis","Can things get any worse for Papa John s Pizza?After the nationwide fast food chain s CEO,  Papa  John Schnatter remarked that he was angry that the NFL hadn t  nipped [player protests] in the bud a year and a half ago,  he watched as he lost $70 million in less than 24 hours. No stranger to controversy, Schnatter insisted that the protests were hurting sales of pizza, and he may have had at least a small point: The chain is the  Official Pizza of the NFL,  so as the fortunes of the league go, so goes Papa John s, to a certain extent.Of course, the internet didn t let Schnatter forget that his restaurants make garbage pizza better suited for dumping 400 yards from a tailgate to keep seagulls away.But possibly the worst of the worst happened on Friday, when Schnatter perhaps thought that the controversy was beginning to blow over.The ultra right-wing website The Daily Stormer   well, not the actual website; that was run underground by a series of web hosts dropping them every time they tried to move their hate to another location   posted an article praising Schnatter, making Papa John s not just the official pizza of the NFL, but of the  many sides  of the alt-right. It happened much like the nascent modern Nazi subculture appropriated New Balance shoes after that company s CEO disparaged Barack Obama and praised Donald Trump, and pretty similar to the way they adopted Wendy s as their official cheeseburger after someone with access to that restaurant s Twitter (but apparently not a Google search box) mistakenly tweeted the meme that has become the most recognizable symbol of the alt-right,  Pepe  the frog.So will this be the end of Papa John s? Not likely. Back in 2012, Schnatter famously said he was going to cut employee hours and raise prices in retaliation for the passage of Obamacare. Papa John s seems to have weathered that storm well enough to maintain Schnatter s multi-million-dollar home with the turntable driveway for parking limousines.But being praised in an article that uses the phrase  negro fatigue  as the Stormer article does is sure to leave a bad taste in the mouths of consumers. A worse taste, even than the pizza they serve.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News

" With Just Two Words, GOP Congressman ADMITS He Doesnâ€™t Answer To His Constituents","The GOP Congress, with the approval of Donald Trump, is putting forth yet another tax bill that would take food off the tables of regular people so the wealthy can hoard even more money. You would think they would show a modicum of shame, that they would at least pretend that they are working for the voters, but this is the age of Trump and they are proud of the oligarchy they ve created. They are so proud they are literally saying, in front of reporters, that they don t care what the voters think about this wildly unpopular tax plan.Several polls have proven that tax cuts, especially tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, barely scratch the surface of Americans  concerns. It s hardly even a priority for brainwashed Republicans. Only about a quarter of Americans overall think tax reform should be a top priority, while barely half of Republicans (51 percent) think it should head the agenda.The majority of Americans have had it with the trickle down argument and they don t believe that a corporate tax cut will lead to more jobs.Some GOP selling points aren t sinking in. One of Republicans  biggest talking points is that a corporate tax cut will benefit workers (though even right-wing economists have cast doubt on White House estimates on this point).But nearly 60 percent of people believe corporations won t  use that money to create jobs,  according to the CBS poll. Likewise, approximately half of people in both the CBS and NBC/WSJ polls said they think the bill would grow the economy   a plurality but not a clear majority.Source: NPRScrew what voters think, at least that s the mindset of Republicans who know exactly who put them in office, the oligarchy. A Vox reporter confronted some GOP Congressmen about the tax bill that few people have seen and the most telling answer came from Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY), who in two words told us exactly what he thinks of his constituents  opinions:Others had answers the weren t quite as callous and were a bit more measured. They fell back on denial and Trump s  fake news  copout. I don t believe that poll,  stressed Texas Rep. Mike Conaway. I would love to see those polls, because those aren t polls of my constituents,  added Missouri Rep. Jason Smith.Golshan couldn t find a single Republican member of Congress who would acknowledge how unpopular the idea is with voters of passing a tax bill to let corporations pay even less of their fair share.Republicans need to work a little harder on their messaging of their pet tax bill. According to FiveThirtyEight.com, Republicans have a chance to pass their first major initiative since Trump took office, as long as they can get Americans to back it. So far, they are failing and their cavalier responses to Americans  concerns aren t helping. Of course, Collins might be right. As long as they have gerrymandering, voter suppression and Russia in their back pockets, voters  opinions might not actually matter.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images.",News
 One Hero Made Donald Trump Panic And Made Twitter Celebrate (DETAILS),"If you were bored on Thursday night at around 7pm ET and felt the need to peruse President Trump s Twitter feed, you might ve instead encountered a blue page bearing the message,  Sorry, that page doesn t exist! , eventually just replaced with an even more generic-looking response:Yes, for a whole 11 minutes Donald Trump s Twitter account was down.Twitter is sometimes seen as that one avenue where voyeurs and sociopaths can coexist so it comes as no surprise that the medium is a favorite of President Trump s, as well as his supporters and critics alike. It is where we get to see the truly uncensored leader, not following a script, just posting exactly what comes to mind and digging his hole deeper with every tweet. A normal day for Trump generally begins by taking to Twitter to attack Democrats, North Korea and, of course, kneeling NFL players before he starts his presidential duties.However, some have grown tired of Trump s early morning poop-tweets and one person decided to take action. That s right, this wasn t the result of some glitch of sorts, but was actually an inside job. To be more specific, it was the work of a heroic Twitter employee on their last day on the job. Twitter initially released a statement saying the President s feed was inadvertently deactivated due to a human error,  but it didn t take long for the truth to come out.Earlier today @realdonaldtrump s account was inadvertently deactivated due to human error by a Twitter employee.

Many have requested that President Trump be banned from Twitter under the belief that his tweets about North Korea could be bringing the United States closer to the brink of nuclear war, something Twitter has declined to do, claiming they must weigh the newsworthiness of Trump s tweets with its violent rhetoric.Instead, on this occasion, it was just a Twitter employee having the intestinal fortitude to do what many have probably fantasized about doing on their last day of work.Featured image via screenshot",News
 Sarah Huckabee Sanders SHREDDED By L.A. Times For Truth-Twisting â€“ This Is Brilliant,"Donald Trump very obviously has a specific type of woman he likes, and whom he prefers to represent him. He is a horrid misogynist who thinks women s worth lies solely in our ability to stir his penis to life (or not). He likes his women tall, thin, big-breasted basically supermodel quality. Knowing that, one would think that Sarah Huckabee Sanders doesn t fit his mold nearly well enough to be his press secretary, and yet, she is. Why?In a brilliant op-ed for the L.A Times, David Horsey turns a light bulb on about why Trump would prefer Sarah Sanders over virtually anyone else (including Sean Spicer)   she has a singular comfort with distorting the truth that Spicer never had, and she s obviously far more comfortable with it than anyone besides Kellyanne Conway. Horsey says: But now I get it. Anyone who is going to be tasked with the job of explaining this president to the news media needs to be comfortable with saying things that are demonstrably not true. That was the problem with Sanders  predecessor, Sean Spicer. Lying seemed to fluster him. When he was challenged on any blatantly erroneous statement, he would get red-faced and petulant. It was as if he was trying to signal a message to reporters:  Come on, guys, lay off! Don t make me humiliate myself on live TV!  [emphasis mine]By contrast, Sanders is perfectly fine with saying that Paul Manafort s indictment has nothing whatsoever to do with Trump. She had no issue spinning Trump s tax breaks for the wealthy into a $4,000/year raise for American families. Despite being a woman, she s perfectly fine saying that the women accusing Trump of sexual assault are all lying simply because that s Trump s position. As for the entire Russia scandal, including a report that Trump has lost his mind over it, Horsey says: Taking the offensive, Sanders confidently delivered the new Republican talking point that, if anyone were guilty of colluding with Moscow, it was Hillary Clinton   which is the boldest evasion anyone in the Trump camp has come up with, so far.  [emphasis mine]Horsey paints Sanders as the spin-meister she is   someone who effortlessly puts forth the idea that the facts of anything and everything are  nothing more than what you want them to be. By that new standard, Sanders is a pro.  [emphasis mine]And that, ladies and gentleman, is why Trump has her as his press secretary. He needs someone who has a demonstrable problem with the truth.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News
 Trumpâ€™s Energy Secretary Has An Idea For Stopping Sexual Assault â€“ This Is INSANE,"Who knew that Rick Perry would come up with an idea for stopping sexual assault? He no doubt thinks he s absolutely brilliant because his idea is fossil fuels. Yes, he thinks fossil fuels can help stop the problems with massive rape in developing countries. But while he thinks he s shining a light on an amazingly novel idea, he s really being insanely offensive to all the victims of rape in the world. Here s how he managed to combine fossil fuels with sexual assault: But also from the standpoint of sexual assault, when the lights are on, when you have light that shines, the righteousness, if you will, on those types of acts. So from the standpoint of how you really affect people s lives, fossil fuels is going to play a role in that. I happen to think it s going to play a positive role. Well gee, so sorry you were raped but your village doesn t have electricity yet. That totally would have stopped it. Does he not know that they already have ways to light their dwellings and their villages? We won t even ask whether he understands what rape is and why it happens   it s clear he thinks it s only a violent act that happens in darkness.That s not just offensive to rape victims in the developing world, it s offensive to all rape victims everywhere. But Rick Perry hails from the crowd that blames women for sexual assault and harassment. It wouldn t be surprising to find that he thinks keeping lights on will stop the rape gangs in South Africa and elsewhere.There s also the fact that Perry doesn t believe that fossil fuels are responsible for accelerating climate change, so of course he s going to put his ignorance on display like this. To that, we say, go home, Perry. You are disgusting.Featured image via Kevin Dietsch-Pool/Getty Images",News
" Jeff Sessions: Oh, You Mean THAT Russian Contact. I Remember Now!","The Attorney General of the United States lied under oath, but that seems to be the status quo in the Trump administration. During Sessions  confirmation hearing in January, he told Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) that he was  not aware  of evidence that anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government during the campaign. But today, his selective memory issues seem to be clearing up. However, the only reason Sessions is admitting there was contact with the Trump administration is because of court documents that were unsealed Monday revealing that Donald Trump s former campaign adviser, George Papadopoulos, floated the idea of setting up a meeting between the former reality show star and Russian President Vladimir Putin in March 2016. Papadopoulos claimed he had  connections  that could help arrange the meeting between Trump and Putin.On top of that, an Instagram picture on Trump s account shows Sessions attended the meeting in which Papadopoulos made the suggestion.So, it s kind of a big deal, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller is all up in this administration s business over the Russia scandal. A source familiar with the matter told NBC that Sessions rejected the meeting.And apparently, Sessions doesn t remember if he remembers that. Or something.Source clarifies: Unclear whether Sessions recalls nixing the Papadopoulos proposal for Trump Putin meeting   though he did do so.  Ken Dilanian (@KenDilanianNBC) November 2, 2017Sen. Franken isn t too happy about the  alarming pattern  in which Sessions  apparently failed to tell the truth, under oath, about the Trump team s contacts with agents of Russia a hostile foreign power that interfered in the 2016 election. Once again, developments in the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election have brought to light evidence that you failed to tell the truth about your interactions with Russian operatives during the campaign, as well as your awareness of Russian contacts by other members of the Trump campaign team,  Franken wrote in a statement. We must get to the bottom of what happened so that we can prevent it from happening again,  Franken wrote.  I am deeply troubled that this newest revelation strongly suggests that the Senate and the American public cannot trust your word. In June, Sessions said that he had  no knowledge  of any conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign about  any type of interference with any campaign  by Russians.Who knew that a racist elf would lie? Certainly, none of us would have ever guessed.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News
" â€˜Alt-Rightâ€™ White House Reporter Gets Fooled By Fake Tweet, Reports Upcoming Civil War","When Donald Trump allowed popular Nazi blog The Gateway Pundit to have a correspondent show up at the White House, many questioned that decision   but if The Donald was going for comic relief, we re forced to admit that the inclusion of Lucian Wintrich is a complete success.Recently, the White House reporter followed up on a hot tip he received from noted Twitter political sociologist guy Krang T. Nelson informing America that  Antifa  (a blanket term for people who oppose fascism) is breeding a team of super soldiers (yes, like in Marvel comics) which they will unleash on America in a devastating attack on white people   a first strike in a new civil war he reported on completely seriously in a now-disappeared scare piece. Can t wait for November 4th when millions of antifa supersoldiers will behead all white parents and the small business owners in the town square,  Krang tweeted   an obvious joke, unless you re a f*cking idiot.Enter Wintrich, who reported it completely seriously then threw a massive tantrum when the obviously humorous comment turned out to be fake.In addition, a bunch of right-wingers mass reported Krang s post and got him suspended from Twitter. Anyone with a single crease in their brain could see that my post was satire, but alas, the internet has no shortage of morons, and the tweet was apparently reported into oblivion,  Krang T. Nelson said of the attack in an op-ed he wrote for Vice.  The ensuing suspension was so thorough that my work account was axed for using the same phone number. (I reached out to Twitter for comment in connection with this story, but had yet to hear back at the time of publication.) It s worth noting that Donald Trump has not once been suspended from Twitter.Unfortunately, this is common fare for the Stupid Part of America. They genuinely believe that Hillary Clinton is running a child sex slavery operation out of the basement of a pizza restaurant that doesn t even have a basement, that  antifa  is going to murder white women, or even that Malia Obama got herself arrested buying six pounds of marijuana and somehow managed to fit it into a Prada handbag. But when the truth comes out they blame the people who are laughing at them instead of themselves for being so goddamn stupid.Wintrich is just the latest example that the Party of Fake News and personal responsibility produces the majority of the former and has no sense of the latter.Featured image via screengrab",News
 Papa John Attacks The NFL And First Amendment After His Sh*tty Pizza Loses Him A Small Fortune,"Rather than take personal responsibility for the losses, CEO John Schnatter is making excuses.NFL players, both black and white, have been taking a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice. Conservatives lost their shit and decided to boycott the NFL. However, while viewership is slightly down, it s not enough to affect the corporate profits of businesses who are partnered with the league.But Schnatter blamed the NFL and the protests anyway after a quarterly report caused investors to dump their Papa John s stock, which caused Schnatter to lose $70 million from his personal fortune Leadership starts at the top, and this is an example of poor leadership,  Schnatter whined.  We are totally disappointed that the NFL and its leadership did not resolve the ongoing situation to the satisfaction of all parties long ago. This should have been nipped in the bud a year and a half ago. The controversy is polarizing the customer, polarizing the country. In other words, Schnatter thinks the NFL should have banned players from kneeling during the national anthem, a move that would have violated their constitutional rights.Let s not forget that NFL players were not kneeling en masse until Donald Trump, whom Schnatter supports, attacked Colin Kaepernick and the NFL in the first place. It was Trump s attacks that caused players to join the protest.So if Schnatter should blame anyone, he should blame Trump.Let s also not forget that Schnatter repeatedly attacked President Obama over the Affordable Care Act, even going so far as to raise the price of pizza and cut his employees  hours so he wouldn t have to provide health insurance to them. Papa John s has also been guilty of stealing wages.All of this caused Americans to boycott Papa John s, which could have caused the chain to lose money as well.Schnatter s claims are also full of shit because Pizza Hut executives say their sales have not been affected by the protests. We re not seeing impact on any of that on our business,  CEO Greg Creed said.Of course, Schnatter really doesn t have anything to bitch about. After all, he is still worth over $800 million and owns a sprawling 40,000 square foot castle in Kentucky, which includes a pool, a golf course, a 22 car garage, and a drawbridge along with two other homes in Florida and Utah.Schnatter is a greedy prick who should really only blame himself for the financial losses his company has suffered. And frankly, the NFL should cut ties with Papa John s in retaliation for this unfair attack. Then he ll really have something to bitch about.Featured Image: YouTube",News
 Trump Is Literally Sabotaging The Case Against The NYC Terrorist By Not Keeping His Mouth Shut,"If Donald Trump keeps tweeting about the NYC terrorist like this he will prevent justice from being served.Earlier this week, a terrorist killed eight people using a vehicle. Police captured him alive. So now we not only can get information that could be vital, we can try him in a court of law and get justice for the victims and their families.But justice won t happen if a fair trial cannot be had.And that s why Trump needs to stop tweeting about it right now.On Wednesday night, Trump seriously damaged the suspect s ability to get a fair trial by calling for him to receive the death penalty.NYC terrorist was happy as he asked to hang ISIS flag in his hospital room.

 4 Reasons Why This Little-Known Trump Aide Is More Dangerous To Trump Than Paul Manafort,"On Monday, news broke that Trump s onetime campaign manager, Paul Manafort, had been indicted in connection with Robert Mueller s investigation into Russian interference in our election. Ever since then, everyone s been buzzing about just how dangerous Manafort can be to Trump now. However, we also learned that another Trump associate by the name of George Papadopoulos had been arrested over the summer and pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.And Papadopoulos may well be more important to this investigation than Manafort, despite the fact that he isn t that well known. Why? Because contrary to what Sarah H. Sanders tries telling the media, he was a foreign policy adviser on Trump s campaign who did, in fact, try colluding with the Russians. And it s his testimony and documents that could bring Trump s presidency crashing down around him.One official connected to the campaign, and who reportedly witnessed Papadopoulos  efforts to get Trump to meet with Russian officials, says that Trump didn t dismiss the idea of working with Russia when it was brought up. If Papadopoulos can show that s what actually happened, Trump himself will be in a lot of trouble sooner than expected.During his confirmation hearing back in January, Sessions told Senator Al Franken that he wasn t aware of any evidence that anyone colluded with Russia. He later walked that back, but Papadopoulos apparently told various foreign policy committee members about his contact with Russia   a committee which Sessions chaired. Now, Sessions can claim that he opposed the collusion that Papadopoulos was trying to set up, but then he opens himself up to a perjury charge. Either way, he s fucked.It looks like Papadopoulos was meeting with Russians because they claimed to have dirt on Hillary. His contacts go back to before Don Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort met with a Russian attorney who claimed to have dirt on Hillary. (Don Jr. originally lied, saying that the meeting was about reinstating adoptions between us and Russia, but then released his own emails that proved he d lied.)Then the DNC was hacked, and the hack was traced back to Russia. Trump even called on Russia to release Hillary s missing emails during the RNC convention; a comment that has been analyzed again and again with some dismissing it as a joke and others saying it was evidence of something deeper.There s currently no evidence that anything actually came of that June 2016 meeting. However, if Papadopoulos can back up what he said in his plea agreement about the campaign knowing, then it stops being a scandal and becomes active collusion.Manafort and Gates have been charged with things like money laundering, failure to register as foreign agents, etc. The key with these two is whether Mueller can get them to roll over on Trump and other highly placed officials in exchange for lesser charges.Papadopoulos, on the other hand, told the FBI that his Russian contacts weren t anyone important and that they had nothing to do with Trump, his campaign, or the election. We now know he was in Europe, meeting with Russians and trying arrange meetings between none other than Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. There s a direct line back to the campaign there, whereas the charges against Manafort and Gates could be seen as only tangentially related.Papadopoulos is already a cooperating witness in Mueller s investigation, and there is no evidence yet that Manafort or Gates have flipped, or will flip. And since everything about Papadopoulos  arrest has to do with his activities on the campaign, that makes him far more dangerous to Trump right now than Gates and Manafort.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News
 Former Ambassador Accuses Trump Of Violating Constitution Every Time A Diplomat Visits,"While the Trump administration is still reeling over the fact that Special Investigator Robert Mueller has now arrested three people with close ties to the administration over its ties to Russia, there is another serious alleged violation of the law that everyone should be making bigger headlines.According to a former Ambassador from Mexico, the Trump administration is *ahem* encouraging world leaders to stay at Trump properties while they are visiting in the United States.Arturo Sarukhan, who served as Mexico s ambassador to the United States from 2007 to 2013, tweeted on Tuesday that a former U.S. diplomat told him the U.S. State Department s protocol emphasizes to world leaders that they should use Trump s D.C. hotel for official visits.Sarukhan s tweet also uses the term  kakistocracy,  which means government by the worst people.Source: Think ProgressKakistocracia: ex funcionario EU me dice q Protocolo DptoEstado fue instruido a enfatizar a gobs? usar HotelTrump p/ viajes oficiales a DC  Arturo Sarukhan (@Arturo_Sarukhan) October 31, 2017If this is true, this is a clear violation of the Constitution s Emoluments Clause, which forbids U.S. officials from receiving anything of value from foreign leaders because it could lead to corruption. Of course, the ethics ship sailed away from the White House the moment Donald Trump took office, so it s pretty believable that Trump would strong-arm people to stay at his properties. He s been accused of doing it before.Back in May, someone projected  Emoluments Welcome  and  Pay Trump Bribes Here  on Trump s D.C. hotel.Had a lot of fun projecting #emolumentswelcome on Trump hotel pic.twitter.com/FlFr2ITJtj  robin bell (@bellvisuals) May 16, 2017Being projected on Trump Hotel in DC right now. #resist pic.twitter.com/RJEAqOnGgp  Tim Hogan (@timjhogan) May 16, 2017Trump is currently facing a number of lawsuits, including from members of Congress, about his violating the Emoluments Clause.In June, Think Progress said this:Trump s new downtown DC hotel has hosted embassy events for Azerbaijan and Kuwait, who switched to the Trump hotel from their original booking at the Four Seasons. The hotel hosted an annual conference sponsored by the Turkish state last month a conference that in previous years was habitually held at the Ritz Carlton. And, since Trump s election, a Saudi-backed lobbying campaign spent around $270,000 at the hotel for lodging and catering costs.When a federal official, especially the President, profits off of foreign dignitaries, conflicts abound. It s difficult to claim the moral high ground or to impose sanctions when our own government is running a pay-for-play scam, which is exactly what this is.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News
 Trump Is Throwing Jared Kushner Under The Bus Over Mueller Indictments,"The White House is falling apart following indictments against two former Trump associates and a third who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.  Here s what Manafort s indictment tells me: Mueller is going to go over every financial dealing of Jared Kushner and the Trump Organization,  said former Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg.  Trump is at 33 percent in Gallup. You can t go any lower. He s fucked. According to Vanity Fair, Trump is reportedly blaming White House adviser Jared Kushner, who is also his son-in-law, for his role in decisions that led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller.Trump spoke to President Steve Bannon on Tuesday and blamed Kushner for the firings of Mike Flynn and James Comey, that led to Mueller s appointment. Furthermore, Trump agreed with Roger Stone recently when the Dirty Trickster told him Kushner was giving him bad political advice.  Jared is the worst political adviser in the White House in modern history,  Nunberg said. I m only saying publicly what everyone says behind the scenes at Fox News, in conservative media, and the Senate and Congress,  he continued.Advisers want Trump to consider ways to neutralize Mueller, from conciliation to a declaration of all-out war, according to Vanity Fair. One Republican said that a good move would be for Trump to get his poll numbers up. Trump s numbers are lower than any other president s in the history of modern polling, so that would be a neat trick. The establishment has proven time and time again they will fuck Trump over,  a Bannon ally told the paper. SURE, it s the Deep State globalists who are trying to hurt Trump, when actually, the former reality show star hurts his agenda every time he tweets to lash out at the world. Trump can t afford to fire Mueller politically,  Stone said, but the so-called president has also reportedly complained about Mueller s investigation being allowed to continue.Stone wants Trump to call for a special prosecutor to investigate the Uranium One non-scandal, which has been debunked, but it s just an effort to use Hillary Clinton as a shield.We re wondering how First Lady Ivanka Trump feels knowing that her husband is getting blamed for her father s scandals.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News

We will stop this craziness! @foxandfriends  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 1, 2017Let s keep in mind that this attack happened on Trump s watch. Prior to yesterday s attack, no terrorist had used a vehicle to murder American citizens. Trump promised to keep Americans safe and he promised to wipe out ISIS. He failed.And instead of taking responsibility, Trump decided to blame the top Democrat in the Senate.But Schumer was quick to respond, and he hammered Trump with his own budget, which Republicans are poised to pass.As it turns out, Trump eliminated anti-terrorism funding in his budget and refused to put it back even after the NYPD announced that their anti-terror program would be wiped out by the cut.Schumer wasted no time pointing out Trump s hypocrisy. I have always believed and continue to believe that immigration is good for America. President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be focusing on the real solution   anti-terrorism funding   which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget. I m calling on the President to immediately rescind his proposed cuts to this vital anti-terrorism funding. Basically, Trump would be inviting terrorists to attack the United States by cutting anti-terrorism funding. So instead of worrying about our immigration policies, Americans should be angry about Trump s irresponsible decision to cut funding that helps law enforcement keep us safe.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News
 Watch GOP Senator Almost Knock Over American Flags As He Dodges Indictment Questions (VIDEO),"A Capitol Hill press conference that was supposed to be about judicial nominations went quickly south when Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) suddenly felt the need to sneak out, and in the process almost knocked over the flags behind the podium.The podium was being held by Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX). Anybody have any questions for Senator Grassley, or anybody else here, on this topic?  Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, asked reporters, making clear he didn t want questions about the indictments and guilty plea involving three of President Donald Trump s campaign aides to dominate the news conference.When reporters pressed to get on-camera comment about the legal problems facing Trump campaign aides Paul Manafort, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos, the usually accommodating Cornyn tried to deflect, saying the issue wasn t in the Senate s  wheelhouse. As multiple reporters shouted out, Grassley, who chairs the judiciary committee, which is investigating alleged Russian meddling in US elections, decided to slip out.Source: CNNAt about the 20 second mark, you can see Grassley start anxiously planning his exit. Even while Cornyn was answering questions, Grassley continued to eye the exit, just behind the flags. Then a reporter asked about the indictment of Trump s former campaign chair, Paul Manafort. Behind Cornyn, the flags begin to rock and you see a head appear and then soon disappear through the exit, but since the flags were blocking the doors, Grassley almost knocked them over on his way out. Just imagine for a moment if a Democrat had done that. They would forever be labeled anti-American.The flag episode is not why I d label Grassley anti-American. I would label him anti-American because he s attempted to obstruct and deflect the investigation into Russian collusion from its inception.Here s the video:CLIP: Sen. @ChuckGrassley exits news conference via door behind American flags.Full news conference here: https://t.co/mdeAUFERPh pic.twitter.com/IHdgD7hXlT  CSPAN (@cspan) October 30, 2017  ",News
 WATCH: Trumpâ€™s Chief Of Staff John Kelly Just Admitted That He Doesnâ€™t Think There Was Anything Wrong With Slavery,"The Civil War was about slavery. In fact, slavery was the one issue that threatened to rip the union apart before the Constitution was even ratified. At the convention in Philadelphia, the  Three-Fifths  compromise was made due to the southern states wanting more representation in the House of Representatives due to wanting their slaves to count as part of the Constitution. So, the states that would go on to become the Confederate States of America actually forced the Founders to protect slavery in the original Constitution.These  compromises  would be done repeatedly, through different types of fugitive slave laws, and other compromises like the creation of the 36-30 line   known today as the Mason-Dixon line. Slavery was allowed below that line, and was not allowed above it. That compromise was later threatened with the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which would allow the incoming state of Kansas to vote on whether or not to allow slavery, rather than having the state automatically enter as either a slave state or a free state. This resulted in  Border Ruffians  violently crossing the line into Kansas to make sure that Kansas allowed slavery. This conflict would come to be so bloody that it was known as  Bleeding Kansas. Now, all of this led to one thing: There were states who wanted the United States to allow slavery, and those who knew it to be a brutal, immoral institution that needed to end. Hence, no matter what the white supremacist revisionist history and propaganda says, the Civil War was about slavery. However, Donald Trump s Chief of Staff, John Kelly, seems to need that little history lesson.In a Tuesday appearance with right-wing hack Laura Ingraham, Kelly had a few words regarding famed Confederate General Robert E. Lee, with regards to the recent controversies over statues honoring the Confederacy. He said of the pro-slavery general: I would tell you that Robert E. Lee was an honorable man. He was a man that gave up his country to fight for his state, which 150 years ago was more important than country. It was always loyalty to state first back in those days.  Now it s different today. But the lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War, and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand. I can only come to the conclusion that this means that the so-called  adult in the room  in Trump s chaotic, incompetent, scandal-ridden White House is either too ignorant of history to know what kind of man he just used the word  honorable  to describe, or he is just A-OK with slavery, and equates white supremacy and owning human beings with the likes of those who would liberate those human beings who were so brutally held in bondage against their will for so many years that we, their descendants, still suffer injustices as a result, even today.Next time someone says the Trump Administration isn t full of white supremacists, show them this.Watch Kelly s dangerous remarks below:Enough about John Kelly being the  adult in the room.

 Legal Community SCHOOLS Trumpâ€™s Lawyer For Claiming Collusion Is Not A Crime,"Donald Trump s attorney Jay Sekulow made a fool of himself on Tuesday morning.During an interview with ABC host George Stephanopoulos, Sekulow actually claimed that collusion is not a crime in an effort to defend Trump after his associate George Papadopoulos plead guilty to lying to FBI agents about meeting with Russians. He was a volunteer with the campaign, he served on one of the committees,  Sekelow said.  He was involved with individuals that purported to be somehow involved with Russia or Russian government   it s not clear from the documents. The end result is the meeting doesn t take place. So what you had is you had all this conversation about collusion. Remember this, collusion in and of itself   there s no crime of collusion. Even Stephanopoulos knew that claim was bullshit. Collusion is cooperation and that s what he was doing with Russians,  Stephanopoulos replied.Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, collusion is just another word for  conspiracy,  which is a crime. A MAJOR crime.Sekulow s claim was immediately debunked by prominent members of the legal community.Harvard University law professor John Coates and University of California, Irvine law professor Rick Hasen schooled Sekulow. It is a federal crime to conspire with anyone, including a foreign government, to  deprive another of the intangible right of honest services,  Coates told Politifact after Fox News host Eric Bolling made the same claim in July.  That would include fixing a fraudulent election, in my view, within the plain meaning of the statute. If others participated in the scheme to do this it could be a conspiracy,  Hasen added.  Whether you want to call that  collusion  or not seems besides the point. In short, Trump s own attorney doesn t understand the law and apparently thinks that the use of the word  collusion  absolves Trump and his campaign team of any crimes. But that s simply not the case and any self-respecting judge would laugh at Sekulow in open court if he tried to use such a defense.Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images",News
 WATCH: Hannity Loses His Sh*t And Refers To Hillary As â€˜President Clintonâ€™ During UNHINGED Rant,"Sean Hannity threw a massive temper tantrum on Monday night in defense of Donald Trump.The Fox News host went off on a seriously delusional rant about Hillary Clinton, even referring to her as  President Clinton  on two occasions.Hannity whined about the indictments against Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, and just like Donald Trump, attempted to shift the focus from Trump s Russia collusion to Hillary Clinton. This is beyond insanity and it s inexcusable,  Hannity whined.  Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, the Obama Administration allowed your national security to be compromised in what is an unprecedented way and few in the media will touch this story. Major crimes were committed. They knew about it. They did nothing before the deal. Hannity is referring to the Uranium One deal the Obama Administration made with Russia back in 2010. Trump himself has been bellowing about it for quite some time now in a desperate effort to distract from his very real crimes.Basically, the deal gave a Russian company no more than a 51 percent stake in a Canadian-based mining company and ownership of  20 percent of the currently licensed uranium in-situ recovery production capacity in the U.S. This deal does not harm our national security as Hannity claims, nor did Hillary Clinton personally approve of the deal. Factcheck.org recently gave a run-down of the deal and thoroughly debunked Trump and Hannity s claims. As we ve written before, there is no evidence that donations to the Clinton Foundation from people with ties to Uranium One or Bill Clinton s speaking fee influenced Hillary Clinton s official actions,  FactCheck.org wrote.  That s still the case. In fact, not only did such a deal require approval from several federal agencies and committees, only 11 percent of overall U.S. production of uranium comes from Uranium One. And that uranium is sold to operators of commercial nuclear reactors. Basically, the uranium is being sold to us as it would have if Uranium One was not held by a Russian company. This deal was under a lot of scrutiny before it went through, and was even publicly announced. But Hannity did not utter one word about it when it happened.Of course, Hannity is still insisting that the evidence is on Trump s side despite the fact that there is a lot of evidence proving that he and Trump are full of shit and that Trump committed treason to steal an election. We are at a major crisis point in America tonight. Do we have equal justice under the law in this country today? If you or I or anybody in this room with me now or watching TV with you, if we ever did anything close to what the Clintons, the DNC, and others did, we would be rotting in a jail cell tonight hoping our friends would send us a cake that had a file. The only difference between Trump/Russia collusion is that we have the evidence, and after a year of black helicopter conspiracy theories, they have none. And just like we have the evidence, when it comes to Clinton and her email server scandal, why hasn t she been charged? Here s the video via YouTube.Hillary Clinton has not been charged because she didn t commit any crimes and there is ZERO evidence that she did. Trump, on the other hand, is about to go down for collusion.Clearly, nobody gives Trump a blowjob like Sean Hannity. And frankly, he and Fox News should be sued for slander.Featured Image: Screenshot",News
 Seth Meyers Summed Up Mondayâ€™s Events Perfectly [VIDEO],"Monday, October 30, 2017 is one of those dates that will go down in history, the type where future generations will ask you where you were and what you were doing when former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, as well as Manafort s top aide, Rick Gates surrendered to the FBI, later entering  not guilty  pleas, while Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pled guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russia as a result of Robert Mueller s probe into President Trump s possible collusion with the country.Infamous moments of historical significance such as these only come around maybe once every 15 or 20 years so when the news broke on Monday morning, we all knew that one thing was for certain   That late-night TV hosts were going to have an absolute field day with this story. Not due to the direct implications of Mueller s investigation, however, but more because of how the President and anyone linked to him would react. Taylor Swift has better coping mechanisms than President Trump so most of us were curious as to what Trump would Tweet or how Fox News would handle the story and neither disappointed.Our late-night hosts didn t let us down, either, but nobody summarized the whole situation better than Seth Meyers during his A Closer Look segment on Late Night with Seth Meyers.

 This 2016 Hannity Tweet Is Now Like A Knife In The Back For Trump,"No one on earth has been a bigger cheerleader for Donald Trump than Fox News  Sean Hannity. In the wake of Monday s indictments of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, Manafort s top aide Rick Gates and with a guilty plea of former economic advisor to Trump, George Papadopoulos, it appears the house of cards is beginning to collapse.Hannity, though, is ready with the pro-Trump propaganda. Immediately after the news of the indictment hit, Hannity was ready with his defense of Trump which means he s blaming Hillary:Not that there wasn t Russian collusion with a 2016 presidential candidate. It s just that her name was not Trump. We now have real evidence that the FBI uncovered a Russian plot dating back to 2009 that involved bribery, extortion, blackmail, money laundering and racketeering. It all came a year before Hillary Clinton and the Obama Administration approved the corrupt Uranium One deal. We have evidence of another Russia scandal, also involving a 2016 candidate not named Trump. We now know that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid over $9 million to help fund the discredited, Russia-linked dossier crafted to ruin then-candidate Donald Trump. This was nothing short of a collaborative effort with the Russians to manipulate the outcome of the last presidential election.Not surprisingly, Trump s statements are mirroring Hannity:Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 30, 2017  Only, Manafort was part of the Trump campaign during many of these alleged crimes and Hannity knows it. In fact, in 2016, he tweeted it:While a Sean Hannity tweet certainly won t stand up in a court of law, Hannity has long been the media sycophant for the Trump administration. If he says Manafort was instrumental in Trump winning the White House, he was.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images.",News

 Guilty As Hell Paul Manafort And Rick Gates Enter â€˜Not Guiltyâ€™ Pleas In Russian Collusion Scandal (TWEET/VIDEO),"The world is exploding right now due to the news that Donald Trump s second campaign manager, Paul Manafort has been indicted on a litany of felony charges by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Manafort, as well as his business associated and fellow Trump campaign official Rick Gates have been taken into federal custody, but both have laughably entered pleas of not guilty to all kinds of high crimes   including really shady stuff like money laundering and conspiracy against their own country.Of course, the Trump White House is in all-out  nothing to see here  mode. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders spent her entire Monday briefing lying through her teeth with regards to the Manfort and Gates situation. As if this weren t bad enough for Team Trump, a third person in their orbit has been charged as well, foreign policy adviser George Padadopoulos. It also seems that this gentleman may be flipping on Trump, because he was caught lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is a crime, and is being listed as a cooperating witness, according to former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara:Special Counsel Mueller appears to have a cooperating witness, George Papadopoulos. That is significant. Time will tell how significant.  Preet Bharara (@PreetBharara) October 30, 2017In short, the entire Trump White House is in deep shit. Sarah Sanders can say all day long that this has nothing to do with Trump s campaign, and they had to go flipping it all back to Hillary, even though she is a private citizen:These people are unbelievable. All I know is that this will continue to get closer to Trump and his inner circle, and they ll be removed in due course. Hopefully, the snakes in that pit continue to turn on each other in order to save their own skins, and we can take our country back from these treasonous squatters.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News

As he did so, every news outlet was busy covering it, reporting on the situation as it developed. Except for Fox News.

 Racistsâ€™ Heads Will Explode When They Find Out White-On-White Crime Is Higher,"Despite what many racists say and regardless of the hand-picked statistics of the federal government in an effort to demonize black people, the rate of white-on-white crime in the United States is far higher than that of African-Americans victimizing white citizens.In a report published last Thursday by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) on  Race and Hispanic Origin of Victims and Offenders 2012-2015,  some staggering figures emerged. Research conducted over a four year period during which  U.S. residents experienced 5.8 million violent victimizations each year  found that the rate of white-on-white violent crime (12.0 per 1,000) was almost four times higher than black-on-white violent crime (3.1 per 1,000).However, even when the facts are blatantly obvious and staring them right in the face, there is no swaying some Republicans who still subscribe to the idea that African-Americans are still the largest threat to themselves and others. Case in point: former White House advisor Sebastian Gorka in this interview last Monday:On a Sinclair station, Gorka refers to ""black African crime on black African crime"" & says black men are killing each other ""by the bushel"" pic.twitter.com/Cbtqm39tTd  Yashar Ali ? (@yashar) October 24, 2017Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill, an African-American himself, shares the same sentiments as Gorka. One of the most dramatically difficult things to fathom in this country is the amount of lives lost   black lives lost   as a result of black-on-black violence,  Hill said on Saturday. In the same year that we experienced about 259 police officer shootings of blacks in 2015, there were 6,000 black lives lost to murders from black people. However, contrary to what both Mr. Gorka and Mr. Hill believe, black men aren t killing each other  by the bushel.  In fact, according to the report, black-on-black violence has decreased exponentially in the last two decades, by almost the exact same rate as white-on-white violence. From 1994 to 2015, white-on-white violence and black-on-black violence declined at a similar rate. White-on-white violence declined 79 percent (from 52.5 to 10.8 victimizations per 1,000 white persons). Black-on-black violence declined 78 percent (from 66.6 to 14.5 victimizations per 1,000 black persons). Information on Hispanic origin of offenders was not collected prior to 2012,  the report stated.It s time that the U.S. government started to report the facts when it comes to the issue of race, instead of dividing the country.Featured image via Brian Blanco/Getty Images",News
 McCain Has The Best Laugh Heâ€™s Had In 80 Years When Heâ€™s Asked THIS About Donald Trump,"It s gotta be hard these days to be John McCain. Standing up to Donald Trump is pretty unpopular among Republicans these days, and we ve seen the proof in how quickly the base turned on some otherwise solidly-conservative GOP Senators who have decided the age of Trump is just too much for them.First Tennessee s Bob Corker then McCain s fellow Arizona Senator Jeff Flake dropped out of the running for reelection, possibly dashing the GOP s hopes for holding on to the Senate in the 2018 elections. But regardless of the fact that they ve both been what old Mitt Romney might call  severely conservative,  red meat Trump voters turned on the two like villagers with pitchforks.That could be, however, because they don t have the credentials John McCain has. When he trolled Trump hard last week on the  bone spurs  he used as an excuse to dodge the draft with all of his silver spoon, private school pals, Trump tried to clap back with a warning that  people have to be careful because at some point I fight back. McCain s answer? I have faced tougher adversaries. Now, you might think Donald Trump is at least smart enough not to come at a former POW with some weak stuff like that, but you d be wrong. Laughably wrong. In fact, go ahead and have a little laugh, because you re in good company.McCain thought it was hilarious.Appearing on The View the following day, the panel gave the senior Arizona Senator a chance to expound a little on his short response to the president s threat: He said he would  fight back  and it wouldn t be pretty. Are you scared? McCain didn t answer immediately because he was busy laughing his ass off. No, I mean, almost with tears in his eyes. There he is, next to his daughter   who just landed the spot on this show   and this old man looks like he s going to cry from laughing so hard. Every woman on the panel is cracking up. People offstage are howling.I just want to know Donald Trump has seen this clip.

 Attempts By Trump To Pardon Anyone Indicted By Mueller Could Backfire On Him In A BIG Way,"There s a lot of talk that, if Mueller indicts friends and associates of Trump over the Russia scandal, Trump will just pardon them and nobody will get punished, least of all Trump. There are two problems with that: First, to accept a pardon is to admit guilt, so he d be throwing them under the bus. But secondly, and perhaps more importantly, any pardons he issues could land him in hot water just that much sooner. According to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), his pardoning power is not exactly absolute.Schiff told ABC News: I don t think the president s power is all that absolute, as people have been suggesting.The president cannot pardon people if it s an effort to obstruct justice, if it s an effort to prevent Bob Mueller and others from learning about the President s own conduct. So, there are limitations. This whole thing really took off when Mueller was appointed special counsel to investigate whether Trump obstructed justice when he fired James Comey. It s true that the Constitution does give the president broad power to issue pardons for  offenses against the United States.  However, we currently don t have any precedent for a president pardoning people tied to his own campaign, and rumors have been circulating that Trump wants to test his pardoning powers to see just how far they actually go.That could be part of why the Tweeter-In-Chief was panicking so badly on Twitter that he screamed,  DO SOMETHING!  in a rant about Hillary Clinton and Uranium One. He might be aware that not only is Mueller getting closer to something that implicates him, which we just can t have, but also that he can t pardon anyone Mueller indicts (or perhaps has been strongly warned away from trying).A pardon would require an admission of guilt, but it would also prevent people from flipping on Trump and singing out the truth in exchange for lesser charges or a lesser sentence. Depending on who s indicted, and what they do, the man who would be king in the White House will find it far more difficult to keep claiming that Russia is just a distraction and there s nothing to it.And so will all his lackeys.Too bad.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News

Therefore, it shouldn t be a surprise if Trump moves to fire Robert Mueller in an effort to shut this probe down before more indictments start coming down. However, thanks to the good people over at MoveOn.org, there is a nationwide plan in place to respond to a Mueller firing within hours. Here is an image, via Twitter, of what that page looks like.

Nobody   not even and perhaps ESPECIALLY not the president   is above legal ramifications for operating in an unlawful fashion. These people are treasonous, and Robert Mueller is going to prove it. If Mueller is removed, we might as well hand the United States of America over to Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin.America, we must be the guardians of our own democratic republic. These incompetent authoritarians are destroying this country with their treasonous ways, and the only way to rid the nation of the scourge of white supremacy, homophobia, misogyny, xenophobia, and all other forms of dangerous bigotry and autocracy operating at the highest levels of our government is to remove and jail them all. Robert Mueller is key to that. He could save us   so if Trump tries to fire Mueller, it is up to refuse to let that stand.Featured image via Ann Heisenfelt/Getty Images",News

Instead, they re now skyrocketing. Polls have also consistently shown growing support for fixing the ACA instead of repealing it. What Trump and his party did was a planned and deliberate political move to harm Obama s legacy without caring who else they hurt.These extreme premium hikes are on Trump s and the GOP s heads.

 Hillary Hilariously Ribs Fox Hosts For Their Insane Obsession With â€˜Impeachingâ€™ Her (VIDEO),"Hillary Clinton is not shutting up and going away as some would like her to. Now that she is a private citizen who has zero intention of running for office ever again, the former First Lady, Senator, Secretary of State, and 2016 Democratic Presidential nominee can speak her mind, and she did so in spectacular fashion at a dinner on Saturday night for the Human Rights Campaign. While speaking to the nation s largest LGBTQIA rights organization, Hillary turned her attentions to Fox News, the network that seems obsessed with her, even though she is a private citizen, and their criminal orange poster boy is the one who is currently squatting in the White House. Hillary said of Fox: It does strike me that in the last few days at least, Fox News seems to think that s where I live, in the White House. Because they spend a disproportionate amount of their time talking about impeaching me. So, look, if they want to make a trade, I d be more than willing. I would have much preferred to have come to the dinner tonight from a slightly closer residence. That s a trade I d be all for   and millions of other Americans feel the same way. The deeper issue here, though, is that Fox, like the rest of the world, knows that an indictment is coming from Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Monday, and they have no way to spin their way out of this one. So, what do they do instead? Tell their brainwashed viewers that Hillary Clinton is the real criminal here, and that Donald Trump is being witch hunted by the  fake media.  They whip those right-wing nuts up into a frenzy, all so that they can keep them just the way they like them: angry, ignorant, and frightening of boogie men on the left who don t exist.Give  em hell, Hillary.

 â€˜DO SOMETHING!â€™: Trump Panics As Muellerâ€™s Investigation Closes In On Him,"With news circulating that Robert Mueller will be handing down his first indictment in the Russia investigation soon, Donald Trump is allowing us to watch him squirm in Twitterland.As usual, Trump demanded that everyone stop looking at him and instead focus on his eternal scapegoat, Hillary Clinton and the phone right-wing  uranium  conspiracy.

 Hillary Clinton TOTALLY Just Rubbed â€˜Indictmentâ€™ Rumors In Trumpâ€™s Big Orange Face (SCREENSHOTS),"Former First Lady Hillary Clinton doesn t tweet nearly as often as current national embarrassment Donald Trump, but hers are far more entertaining than The Donald s.With news circulating that the first of probably many indictments in the Russia investigation is being handed down Monday, Clinton seized upon the opportunity to point out that it was the anniversary of the  Comey letter,  which  was probably decisive  in placing our tiny-handed orange dotard in the office in the first place according to FiveThirtyEight  editor-in-chief Nate Silver. Oh is that today?  Clinton said, linking Silver s tweet.The article Silver links notes that the letter Comey sent to Congress telling them the FBI had learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation  into Clinton s private email server,  upended the news cycle and soon halved Clinton s lead in the polls, imperiling her position in the Electoral College. Republicans and the majority of the media shoved the letter in the American people s faces seemingly non-stop, sticking us with the useless egomaniacal danger to our country who, unlike his predecessor, is embroiled in a legitimate scandal that actually threatens the future of our nation, that we know and hate today.It s good to see that Clinton was able to keep her sense of humor through all of this. It s a good reminder to all of us that we need to occasionally step back and have a laugh at the almost unbelievably stupid situation we ve found ourselves in.Featured image via  Getty Images",News
 Twitter Just Banned A Major Trump Ally For Threatening Journalists (SCREENSHOTS),"Trump advisor Roger Stone says a bunch of wacky stuff on Twitter, but he managed to go too far even for a platform that seems to ban more people for condemning hate speech than anything else.After it was announced that at least one person had been indicted by a grand jury in the Russia probe, Stone went nuts on journalists who reported the information   especially CNN s Don Lemon. There r no credible  fact checks  that clear the Clinton s on Uranium,  Stone wrote in his typical uneducated manner to Lemon.  Even the people at CNN say i are a buffoon behind you back. You come across on tv as a dull witted arrogant partyboi,  the dull-witted Trump ally added.  You lie constantly and no one who knows you thinks you r bright. Don Lemon must be confronted, humiliated, mocked, and punished,  Stone said.  Dumber than dog shit. Stop lying about the Clinton s and Uranium you ignorant lying covksucker !!!!  Stone continued.  You fake news you dumb piece of shit. Stone also told Charles Blow,  U have no cried you fast talking arrogant fake news piece of shit ! It s unclear why Stone has never bothered to learn to spell at above a second-grade level or why he thinks there should be spaces before exclamation marks, but he ll have plenty of time to think about that and possibly learn to spell because he s gone from Twitter.Whoa. Roger Stone lost his shit to such a degree, Twitter suspended his account.So, why hasn't Trump been suspended? pic.twitter.com/849LYIGztl  Stonekettle (@Stonekettle) October 28, 2017Maybe Stone is just worried that he might be indicted, maybe he s just furious that the chickens are coming home to roost but at least we don t have to deal with his bullsh*t anymore.Featured image via Getty Images/screengrab",News
" If Youâ€™re Looking For Ways To Irritate Trump, Here Are Some Tips (IMAGES)","It s been a well-known fact for quite some time that Donald Trump doesn t handle criticism particularly well, but what has become glaringly obvious during his ten-month tenure as the President of the United States is that if his skin were any thinner, he would need to be carried around in a bucket. Remember, this is the same man who filed a $5 billion libel lawsuit against author Timothy O Brien for causing  actual malice  by claiming that Trump was only a multi-millionaire, not a billionaire.Since he s been in office, President Trump has had a fixation on size, from exaggerating the size of the crowd present at his inauguration and other public appearances, to that of the size of his Manhattan penthouse in Trump Tower and even the height of the building itself for that matter.Trump is not a small man, standing around 6 1 , although I ll say 6 2  to save myself from any legal ramifications, but he does have a clear-cut Napoleonic complex.People have been giving Trump a hard time about the size of his hands since the 1980s when Spy magazine dubbed him a short-fingered vulgarian.  The references to the size of then-candidate Trump s hands gathered steam again during his presidential campaign, something that has stuck in his craw to this day with the President still feeling the need to justify his hand size.  My hands are too big!  he said as he attempted to put on a pair of latex gloves while serving meals in early September to those affected by Hurricane Harvey in Houston.If one man could be that affected by a claim that he has small hands, then how would he feel if his entire body were small? We don t exactly know yet, but people are photoshopping Trump to appear small in photos to hilarious effect to get under his skin and the results are just brilliant.There are several approaches photo manipulators are taking, the most obvious being to make him out to be the child that he is:Others are just opting to make Trump seem tiny in general, but particularly when he s in the company of other world leaders:If there s one way to drive a sexist crazy, it is to make them seem minuscule in the presence of a woman, particularly family members. In Trump s case, there s the added advantage of making that woman his arch nemesis, Hilary Clinton:This is a trend that is certainly going to go viral so if you think you ve got some photoshop skills, it s time to get to work and feel free to post your masterpieces in the comments.Featured image via screenshot",News
 BREAKING: The First Charges Have Been Filed In Muellerâ€™s Russia Investigation,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller appears to have turned something up in his investigation into the Trump-Russia scandal. The first official charges have been filed according to CNN, and someone may well be taken into custody in just a few days. While the House and Senate seem to be throwing in the towel on their investigations, and Republicans including Trump himself are ramping up their calls for investigations into Hillary and Uranium One, Mueller is still doing his job.CNN has an exclusive story on this. The charges are currently sealed by order of a federal judge, and Mueller s office would not comment. However, they say: Plans were prepared Friday for anyone charged to be taken into custody as soon as Monday, the sources said. It is unclear what the charges are. Mueller was appointed special counsel shortly after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey. The original investigation was into whether Trump obstructed justice in firing Comey, but lately, he and his team have been interviewing everyone from Paul Manafort to Michael Flynn   both of whom have known ties to Russia and pro-Russia groups.Mueller s office has also been looking into a meeting between Don Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Paul Manafort and a Russian attorney who claimed to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Don Jr. even said he  loved it  when he said he d take the meeting. He promptly lied about it, saying it was about adoptions, and then released emails proving he lied.Since it s not clear what the charges are or who they re against, there are all sorts of possibilities. The dominoes clearly are starting to fall, and Trump s increasingly loud focus on Hillary and Democrats shows that he s running ever more frightened.Featured image via media library",News
 Trumpâ€™s Puerto Rico Contract With Two-Man Energy Company Is Corrupt As F*ck,"When the Trump administration hired a tiny two-man energy operation to restore Puerto Rico s power grid, many suspected that the deal was corrupt as hell and they were absolutely correct.Some beautiful genius leaked a copy of the contract with Whitefish, and Jesus f*cking Chris it s horrific. The contract says that  in no event  may the government audit or review the cost and profit elements  under the agreement, allowing complete secrecy about how the $300 million handed to the company is spent.In addition, both of the  very fine people  who will be doing the work will be given $332 per day for accommodations   way more than the average hotel in Puerto Rico   as well as a luxurious $80 per day for food. Supervisors will be paid $462 per hour and linemen will receive $319 per hour   a pretty sweet deal for the two-year-old company, which has ties to the Trump administration.Whitefish contract states, ""In no event shall [government bodies] have the right to audit or review the cost and profit elements."" Wow. pic.twitter.com/dIyQXb6AK0  Ken Klippenstein (@kenklippenstein) October 27, 2017But the work will be finished on time, right? Not likely.The contract stipulates that the Puerto Rican government waives any claim against Contractor related to delayed completion of work. Incredible: Whitefish contract states Puerto Rican govt ""waives any claim against Contractor related to delayed completion of work."" pic.twitter.com/k4wWxrLFq2  Ken Klippenstein (@kenklippenstein) October 27, 2017San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul n Cruz demanded that the deal be voided, which led Whitefish to angrily tweet, We ve got 44 linemen rebuilding power lines in your city & 40 more men just arrived. Do you want us to send them back or keep working? They are threatening not to do their job which frankly is quite irregular for a company hired to the work for the public sector, the Mayor replied. The contract should be voided right away and a proper process which is clear, transparent, legal, moral and ethical should take place,  Cruz told Yahoo News.The deal is so horrible that even Republicans on the House Natural Resources Committee have a problem with it. The size and terms of the contract, as well as the circumstances surrounding the contract s formation, raise questions regarding PREPA s standard contract awarding procedures,  wrote Reps. Rob Bishop and Bruce Westerman on Thursday.Whitefish says it welcomes investigations into the shady deal: Whitefish Energy appreciates the efforts of the committees to gather information so that they have confidence in the overall process to support the people of Puerto Rico as well Whitefish Energy s capabilities and commitment to deliver on the contract to help restore power and a sense of normalcy for the people of Puerto Rico. Previously, Whitefish s largest government contract was when they received $1.3 million  to upgrade power lines in Arizona.With a contract that throws money at the company with no oversight and no guarantee that work will be completed in a timely manner, this is probably a mistake.featured image via screengrab",News
 WATCH: Former White House Official Suggests On Hannity That Hillary Clinton Should Be Executed,"While on the campaign trail,  Lock her up!  chants repeatedly rang out from the crowd of Trump supporters even though Hillary Clinton has not been charged with a crime of any sort. Trump s former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn also led those chants, saying,  If I did a tenth of what [Hillary Clinton] did, I would be in jail  then later, it was Flynn who was forced to resign over violating federal law. We re still not sure what crime team Trump thinks Hillary is guilty of, but former White House deputy assistant to Trump Sebastian Gorka suggested that Hillary Clinton deserves to be tried for treason and executed, according to ThinkProgress.Gorka made this suggestion on Hannity s show Thursday night. If this had happened in the 1950s, there would be people up on treason charges right now,  Gorka said.  The Rosenbergs, okay, this is equivalent to what the Rosenbergs did, and those people got the chair. Think about it   giving away nuclear capability to our enemies, that s what we re talking about. Watch:Gorka is responding to the Uranium One non-scandal which was whipped up by Steve Bannon and there is zero evidence that Hillary Clinton did anything corrupt. As Judd Legum explains, the  scandal  comes from a book authored by Bannon in 2016 which is ridden with typos. And it was based on a fake press release. In other words, it s fake news.There are other false claims, too.6. The problem is: 1. Hillary Clinton could not have blocked the sale. She was one of NINE cabinet members on a committee  Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) October 27, 2017She didn t even sit on the committee.What isn t fake news is that the White House has lawyered up amid special counsel Robert Mueller investigating any potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. It s so bad that even Donald Trump s lawyer has had to lawyer up.Hannity didn t even bother pushing back on Gorka s violent rhetoric. Instead, he moved on to another guest.Arm yourself with facts, not stupidity and/or conspiracy theories. That s the only way to fight against the propaganda coming from the Trump administration and its allies   because they are gaslighting America with these false accusations.Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.",News
 Trump Just Closed The Office That Coordinates Russia Sanctions,"With Donald Trump late on implementing the new sanctions against Russia, he knew he had to spring into actions. Did he do his job? No. Did he implement the sanctions like a big boy? Nope. What he did was close the office that coordinates said sanctions. Foreign Policy reports:Secretary of State Rex Tillerson eliminated the Coordinator for Sanctions Policy office, which had been led by a veteran ambassador-rank diplomat with at least five staff, as part of an overhaul of the department, former diplomats and congressional sources told Foreign Policy.Instead, the role of coordinating U.S. sanctions across the State Department and other government agencies now falls to just one mid-level official   David Tessler, the deputy director of the Policy Planning Office. The Policy Planning Office, which previously operated as a small team providing strategic advice to the secretary but did not manage programs or initiatives, has grown in power under Tillerson s  redesign  of the department.While the sanctions office was dissolved, the administration missed a key Oct. 1 deadline to implement new penalties against Russia adopted by Congress in August. The move reinforced concerns among both Democratic and Republican lawmakers that the Trump White House is mismanaging the State Department and undercutting the role of U.S. diplomacy.While the administration had time to create chaos by eliminating the sanctions office, they for some reason could not expend the effort to actually enforce the sanctions, which have been repeatedly condemned by Donald Trump.Interesting stuff, that.Featured image via Getty Images/Alex Wong",News
 Yet Another Asshole Just Rammed A Bunch Of Protesters With His Car (VIDEO),"Yet another horrible human being decided to ram his car through a crowd of protesters in California on Thursday.Daniel Wenzyk, who was convicted of committing lewd acts against a child under the age of 14 in 2006, apparently got impatient as protesters rallied for immigrants  rights and did what we can normally expect from horrible human beings: he tried to run a bunch of people down with his car. I think he was trying to get through the crowd,  Lt. Adam Hawley said of the incident, dismissing concerns that the numerous protesters who were injured were  victims of what appears to be a deliberate and hateful crime. We don t have any indication he was trying to harm somebody,  Hawley says. Video of the incident shows Wenzyk deliberately plowing his car through people, which brings Hawley s account heavily into question,In total, six protesters were taken to a hospital for evaluation after the attack. Fortunately, no one sustained serious injuries.Despite Hawley s assertion that the child molester was not trying to hurt anyone, Wenzyk was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon. He was later released pending the results of the investigation.Watch the attack below and decide for yourself if it was deliberate:Man arrested and released after driving through immigration protest in California.

 Judge Who Barred A Mom From Seeing Her Baby For A Year Over Unpaid Fees Resigns,"With all the recent talk of sentencing reform and unfair bail across America, sometimes what it takes is an outrageous case in a small town somewhere to light a fire under activists to demand a change. And even though the resignation of a judge in Pearl, Mississippi, a suburb of the capital with a meager 25,000 residents, isn t really anyone s idea of a revolution, it probably means a lot to the mother at the center of the case.Judge John Shirley of the now-dissolved Pearl Youth Court decided back in August of 2016 that some unpaid court fees were enough to separate  Mother A,  a resident of nearby Jackson, from her baby for a period of 14 months. The unidentified mom and a friend were driving through Pearl one day looking for work when they were pulled over by a police officer who discovered that both women had misdemeanor warrants for minor offenses.Honestly, the story begins with that officer, who is also unidentified in the report from the Clarion-Ledger, the news outlet that first reported the judge s resignation. So much begins with a cop s interaction with a young person   will they detain them? Will they give them a warning? Initial contact with law enforcement often determines the course of a young person s life, and most police are totally aware of that fact. Mother A  had her baby with her that day, and although the woman s grandmother came to the scene immediately to collect the baby, that officer decided to change the young woman s life by requiring her to bring the child before the Pearl Youth Court.If it seems like I m being too hard on the cop, let me assure you, I ve saved most of my hate for Judge Shirley. How an arbiter of justice thinks ordering a young mother to stay away from her newborn baby is anything approaching justice is bewildering to me. But that s just what Judge Shirley did, remanding the infant to the custody of the grandmother and imposing a goddamn NO CONTACT ORDER between Mother A and her baby until the poor (as in, without money) young woman could pay off her court fees.Not only could she not see her child, she couldn t see her grandmother while the baby was present. It was just to be cruel. That s the only explanation.Cliff Johnson, the Director of the Roderick and Solange MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi School of Law, agreed. As a civil rights lawyer in Mississippi, I am no stranger to injustice, but for a judge to prohibit an impoverished mother from having any contact with her baby until monetary payments are made is shocking and repugnant. Such orders are tantamount to judicial kidnapping. Between two people   one cop and one judge   a young woman s life is forever changed, her idea of justice forever skewed, her trust in authority forever hobbled by the fear of a cruelty that exists only for its own sake.Featured image via judgejohnshirley.com",News

 John Lewis Has the PERFECT Birthday Message For Hillary And Trump Will Be FURIOUS (TWEET),"Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) is a civil rights icon. He took beatings in the infamous Bloody Sunday massacre in Selma, Alabama at the height of the Civil Rights Movement. Of course, after Donald Trump was elected, Rep. Lewis, like all sane people, was horrified, and questioned his legitimacy. This led Trump to strike out in his usual petty   and in this case, racist   fashion, and the two have been on the outs ever since. Therefore, What John Lewis had to say to Hillary Clinton for her birthday on Twitter is sure to reignite the feud. Rep. Lewis simply tweeted:Happy Birthday, Madame President @HillaryClinton  John Lewis (@repjohnlewis) October 26, 2017Of course, the Russians helped elect Trump, and Hillary won the popular vote by more than three million people. Further, Trump is clearly unfit for the office he is currently squatting in, and he is destroying our democracy as we speak. The Electors should have refused to certify his election, and the Electoral College should have functioned as the Founders intended. Further, the American public elected Hillary Clinton, a quirk that allowed a few counties in a few states to flip the electoral votes   along with the Russians   elected Trump. He is illegitimate. So, to that end, hats off, Rep. Lewis, and to our beloved Hillary Clinton   Happy birthday, Madame President!Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News
 Milo Yiannopoulos Tells Aussies To Vote Against Marriage Equality Weeks After His Own Gay Wedding,"Milo Yiannopoulos will do anything to keep his name in the spotlight after his shameful resignation from his position as senior editor for Breitbart News back in February and now the homosexual far-right media troll has a new avenue   Trying to convince Australians to vote against marriage equality, despite marrying an unnamed man in a private ceremony in Hawaii just weeks ago.Australians are currently being asked by their federal government to take part in a postal vote to decide whether the law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry, as the law in Australia was altered in 2004 to define marriage as between a man and a woman. Surveys were sent out to Australians aged over 18 years of age and enrolled on the Commonwealth Electoral Role, with results of the mail-in only poll scheduled to be announced on November 15.The vote, coming at a cost of AU$122 million (US$94 million), has stirred up more than its fair share of controversy, with the nation divided over whether to vote  yes  or  no.  Surprisingly, Yiannopoulos has become a rather loud proponent for Australians to vote against same-sex marriage, just weeks after his own gay marriage. My gut would be to vote against it, Yiannopoulos told the Daily Mail, adding  I m gay and a Catholic. The highest priority for me is making sure no church, no believer anywhere, is required to violate their religious conscience. I think those things can co-exist perfectly peacefully. I think the state probably should recognize a gay couple who want to commit to one another,  He continued.  But the paramount consideration is not those gay couples   it is religious freedoms. Another fear that Yiannopoulos has is the effect same-sex marriage could have on gay culture.  One of the few advantages of being gay was that you could tumble out of a nightclub at 1am on a Tuesday and no one could have a go at you for it. But if we re buying into these institutions like marriage, I worry that there will be a deadening effect on gay culture. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but comments like these are more than just a little ironic when they come directly from the mouth of a man who recently had his own gay marriage. Photos surfaced of Yiannopoulos  marriage ceremony in Hualalai, Hawaii late last month, with his spouse named on Wikipedia as  John,  although little else is known.Yiannopoulos resigned from Breitbart in February of this year amid a cloud of controversy after a video emerged where he stated that the relationship between a man or woman and 13-year-old boys can be  perfectly consensual  and a positive experience for the boys.Featured image via Stephanie Keith/Getty Images",News
 Trumpâ€™s ICE Thugs Stop Ambulance Taking 10-Year-Old Girl With Cerebral Palsy To Surgery,"Donald Trump s patriotic  deportation force  just saved America from another dangerous criminal  rapist  and/or  drug dealer    a 10-year-old girl with cerebral palsy.Rosamaria Hernandez s mother brought her across the border illegally when she was three months old because she could not afford treatments in Mexico.Obviously, this child represents a grave threat to America, so as she was being transferred from a medical center in Laredo, Texas to a hospital in Corpus Christi at around 2 a.m. Tuesday the ambulance taking her to surgery was stopped by Border Patrol agents.Trump s thugs allowed the ambulance to continue to Driscoll Children s Hospital, where they waited with guns at the ready outside her room until she was released just in case she tried to sell anyone drugs, rape someone, or go on a rampage.Wednesday, she was dumped into a facility for unaccompanied migrant children   a rare move when a child already living in the United States is involved. What made this move particularly odd is that Rosamaria was not released to her cousin, a U.S. citizen who was riding in the ambulance with her. The fact that they spent so much time and resources to follow this girl, to treat her like she was the highest-priority criminal that ever walked on this earth   the way they re treating her is just beyond what a 10-year-old special needs child should be treated,  says Priscilla Martinez, an immigration advocate.But the fact that she has special needs might be why the Trump administration considers her such a high priority. Recently, Trump s education secretary Betsy DeVos rescinded more than 70 documents outlining rights for special needs students   attacking those who need our help the most seems to be a hallmark of the Trump klan clan.Every single day, the Trump administration sinks lower and lower.

" Alt-Right Trump Lover Loses His Sh*t, Kills His Own Dad For Calling Him A Nazi","You might never suspect that up here in beautiful Washington State, we have one of the largest numbers of white supremacist groups in America. After all, it s gorgeous and relatively quiet, and this is a  blue  state, right? But under all of our fall colors, our lakes, our bike lanes, and our farmer s markets is the same hate you see in the Deep South or the rural Midwest or really anywhere in the United States.In fact, here in the northwest part of the Northwest, there are a surprising number of  Alt-Right  adherents. But considering how rural much of the area between Seattle and Canada is, nobody should be surprised at how many Trump supporters there are. And that seems to have been the catalyst for many people in my neck of the woods who at one time were relatively self-policing: Permission from the president to be bigots. If you listen to Donald Trump when the conversation moves to white nationalism, the subtext is almost that bigotry makes you more American, and we have got some flag wavers in these parts.So last month when my local paper covered a local murder that was, at least peripherally, connected to the Alt-Right, it really wasn t shocking to me. My (now-adult) son and I have attended any number of rallies up and down the freeway corridor we live on, and there is a strong presence of Richard Spencer wannabes and Milo Yiannopoulos sycophants at every single one. But over the fold was a face I knew: Lane Davis, a 33-year-old guy who lived a few doors down from my mom s old house. I saw him in stores and on the street. I bummed him a smoke outside the Safeway more than once.I touched that guy s hand.Image via FacebookHe killed his dad out on Samish Island, an island that s only actually an island because of a river that crosses the farmland you have have to drive through to get out there. You don t think about white supremacists on your way to Samish Island. I didn t anyway. I thought about my niece s wedding and my grandpa s funeral, both held at the Samish Island Community Center. I think about the herons and red-tailed hawks that hang out in those fields. I think about my mom sometimes. She s a Trump supporter and a bigot, but she wouldn t stab anyone like Lane Davis did.Davis worked for Milo for a little while, and he went by the online name  Seattle4Truth,  under which he posted to Reddit, his YouTube channel, and later, a super-mega-extremely-far-right website,  The Ralph Retort  (which I just won t link, so get to googling if that s your thing). And really, the link at the beginning of the last paragraph has a pretty in-depth profile of his various exploits, after The Daily Beast got their hands on the 911 call his mother made that fateful day.But it s incomplete. This is a small place, and it s personal. The judge who signed off on Davis  probable cause affidavit was the same man who gave me custody of my son. My friends are friends with Lane Davis  friends. I guarantee without texting her to ask her that the saleswoman who used to sell furniture for me knew Lane Davis personally and had possibly been to his house. When I tell you about the little place I live in, and how I casually handed out smokes to an eventual murderer, and the geography and wildlife near where that murderer lived, what I want you to do is go back to the words in bold letters a few paragraphs ago.Before Donald Trump, the white nationalists, racists, skinheads, Klan members, and just generally hateful people around here might have said something racist in public once. Maybe they had  No Trespassing  signs all over their deep-woods properties 20 miles up the Skagit River. Maybe they sported  III%  or  Prius Repellent  stickers on their giant trucks with the smokestacks tuned to blast creosote every time they leave a stoplight.Now they kill their dad because he called them a Nazi and tried to kick them out of the house when he got sick of their bullshit.Heck, Lane Davis isn t even the first murderer I ve ever known. I used to play D&D when I was a kid with a dude who killed another guy after a party back in the early 90 s. But that guy, by the time we were teens, we knew he was going to end up in prison. He was disturbed. He was morbid. He was violent.Lane Davis was just a racist until Donald Trump came along.Featured image via screen capture",News
 WATCH: This Amazingly Aware Company Has Created A Brilliant Way To Document Trumpâ€™s Dangerous Tweets,"Donald Trump s Twitter habit is dangerous. When one has the bully pulpit of the White House to speak from, words definitely matter. That s why it s so concerning when Trump threatens nuclear war in 140 characters or less   it s because he could actually carry it out in a matter of minutes, and the whole world knows this   and is terrified he d do it just for kicks. The same is true   albeit to a lesser degree   when Trump cozies  up to dictators like Kim Jung-un and Vladimir Putin, while insulting our allies, like his insulting phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Of course, these are just a few examples, as Trump spends more time tweeting than he does doing anything else.Since Trump s tweets become more alarming by the day and are far too numerous to constantly keep up with, an awesome company has found a way to help do it   and it s super rad. The good folks at Parse/Error have created the  Political Lamp,  which is an entertaining piece of decor that lights up in a lightening storm with every Trump tweet. They say they like to be politically aware, and decided that Trump s Twitter feed is important to document because of what the orange fascist represents: He perfectly embodies a dangerous era. A world where the words of one man   can endanger the fate of millions by spreading the ghost of nuclear war on the planet. Parse/Error is correct. These are dangerous times. The GOP-controlled Congress might be worrying over tax cuts because they are craven cowards who are terrified of Trump lighting them up on Twitter, but they d better serve the nation and the world   as well as their own places in history   by doing all they can to rid the world of the threat of Trump before he kills us all.In the meantime, though, this lamp is amazing, and everyone should have one!

 Melania Trump Hit With SERIOUS Side-Eye After Telling Black Kids To Respect Each Other,"If you haven t noticed, no one associated with the Trump administration (including The Donald s mail-order bride) has any respect for people who aren t white fake Christians.Naturally, people thought it was a bit odd when Melania Trump announced she would be visiting schools to tell kids to be nicer to each other   you know, since her husband spends the majority of his time treating black people, Latino(s)s, and pretty much everyone conservatives hate en masse, like trash.Donald Trump accuses African-Americans of racism three times more than he does whites and pushes dangerous lies originating with Nazi groups about black crime rates.During her visit to Orchard Lake Middle School  in the suburbs of Detroit, Melania told kids to  make sure everyone feels included    a strange statement considering her husband s attempts to ban Muslims from entering the country, his attacks on African-Americans, and his decision to build a wall to keep Mexicans (whom he calls  rapists  and  drug dealers ) from coming into the United States. It is our responsibility to take the lead in teaching children the values of empathy and communication that are at the core of kindness, mindfulness, integrity, and leadership,  she said in a statement regarding the visit.Melania s message would be a positive one coming from anyone else, but kids aren t stupid and they know what sort of people she and her entire family are. When she sat down with some children of color, she earned a  is this idiot kidding me  look from one and some serious side-eye from two others.

" Trump Wets His Pants Over Bob Corker Again, Corker Alerts The White House Daycare Staff","Every time Donald Trump lashes out at Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, he gets his ass handed to him.For instance, when Trump threw a petty temper tantrum because Corker criticized him, Corker responded thusly:It s a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.  Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) October 8, 2017Corker didn t even have to say another word. He just sat back and watched as the world laughed at Trump. Trump even continued throwing a hissy fit by relentlessly attacking and insulting Corker, but to avail. Corker had already kicked his ass.On Tuesday morning, Trump took aim at Corker once again for criticizing Trump s massive tax cuts for the wealthy.Bob Corker, who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal & couldn t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts .

Because Corker has zero f*cks left and he ll burn Trump s tiny-handed ass to the ground every single time.Featured Image: Ron Sachs   Pool/Getty Images",News
 GOP Senate Candidate Says Kids Were Murdered At Sandy Hook Because His God Was Angry," I like your Christ, I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ. That s a pretty easy quote from Gandhi to understand. The man was complicated and problematic in a lot of ways, but this one quote never loses its edge for me, because it s so simple.I have no doubt, however, that firebrand GOP Senate hopeful Roy Moore would dismiss it as the ramblings of a skinny brown cultist. I mean, Hinduism has to be a cult, since there s no story of a savior coming back from the dead, no fire and brimstone and angry gods. I mean, there are, but not Roy s angry God.Roy s angry God is apparently the guy responsible for the murders of 20 children and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary five years ago this December. You see, Roy s God is the one from the Old Testament of the Bible, and the book that Roy gets this particular idea from was apparently written 800 years before Christ came around. Laws were different then. You couldn t eat shrimp or cut your hair at the temples, and I guess if you were a biblical lady, you probably should have been essentially in hiding the entire time you menstruated, because holy shit, was that frowned on.In fact, that book of the Bible, Hosea, has 197 verses in it, and they re essentially all about how terrible everyone is, and how God wants to smite them because they don t love Him enough.They turned away from the Laws Of God, you see, and that meant the Almighty laid the smack down on them. Translated into current context, Roy Moore says, that means God instructed Adam Lanza to pull the trigger on those children and eventually himself, because America, like the Northern Kingdom of Israel before her, is worshiping false idols.Personally, I think Hosea himself was just an angry dude. His wife (Gomer) cheated on him, and God made him give his kids funny names, and he wasn t even sure if the last kid was his  Well, the story s pretty convoluted, really, but suffice it to say, if I had been designated as one of God s main spokesmen and I was going through some shit like Hosea was, I can imagine telling my wife that all the bad things happening to her were happening because she was a sinner.It s not very Christian, though.In fact, it s pretty gross. Here s video of the guy who s probably going to win a Senate seat in Alabama telling a church in the town of Guin that God murders children when He s angry:On TV today we played footage I found of Roy Moore saying the Newtown, CT. shooting happened because we forgot God's law. pic.twitter.com/jzyVD4tIcW  ?andrew kaczynski (@KFILE) September 27, 2017I know the Bible is a long book, but let s hope Roy gets to the New Testament soon.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News
 WATCH: John McCain Mocks President Bone Spurs Over His Draft Deferments,"Sen. John McCain, whose status as a war hero Donald Trump publicly and controversially disparaged, took a swipe at the former reality show star over being the recipient of five deferments in order to avoid the draft because his feet hurt. In contrast, McCain spent more than five years as a prisoner of war in which time he was subjected to torture. He s not a war hero,  Trump said during the presidential campaign.  He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren t captured. During a C-SPAN interview about the Vietnam War airing Sunday night, McCain called out wealthy Americans who were able to get out of being drafted into service in the conflict in which he spent years as a POW. One aspect of the (Vietnam) conflict by the way that I will never ever countenance is that we drafted the lowest income level of America and the highest income level found a doctor that would say that they had a bone spur,  McCain said.  That is wrong. That is wrong. If we are going to ask every American to serve, every American should serve.

 Soldierâ€™s Widow Finally Speaks: â€˜It Made Me Cry Even Moreâ€™ â€” Trump Calls Her A Liar IMMEDIATELY,"Monday morning, things got much worse for Donald Trump and his version of what happened during the phone call he made to Myeshia Johnson, the pregnant widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, who was killed in the Nigerian ambush orchestrated by ISIS.Appearing on ABC s Good Morning America, the grieving widow confirmed the account of the Florida Representative, Frederica Wilson, who was accompanying her on her way to meet her husband s remains when Trump s call came in. Not only did she repeat exactly what Wilson had recalled, but she said it made her  very upset and hurt,  and made her cry  even worse  on what must have been the worst day of her young life.She said that she has  nothing to say  to President Trump.Johnson was sucked into a bitter, public dispute over the call when Wilson recounted what Trump had said as she listened on speakerphone. The timeline of events just spirals from there, with Trump, his spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and his Chief of Staff retired 4-Star General John F. Kelly all taking swipes at Representative Wilson in lieu of overtly calling Myeshia Johnson herself a liar.All of that changed Monday morning.After Mrs. Johnson s appearance on GMA, Trump went back to Twitter one more time. It is now impossible to view what he s saying as anything other than calling her a liar directly.I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2017The  spoke his name  part of the tweet refers to something very specific that Johnson said in the GMA interview   that the President could not remember Sgt. Johnson s name:""[Pres. Trump] couldn't remember my husband's name.   That's what hurt me the most.""   Myeshia Johnson, widow of Sgt. La David Johnson pic.twitter.com/px5io2RbJB  Good Morning America (@GMA) October 23, 2017It seems bizarre at this point that Donald Trump would continue to  defend  himself over his statements, but it s important to remember that the details of this terrorist ambush are still very, very unclear. If the whole affair turns out to be something akin to Benghazi   the attack that killed four Americans in 2012   then public perception will play a big role in who the American public blames for every aspect what happened, including how he handled the deaths.Trump seems pretty eager to shift that blame off himself and onto literally anyone else.Even the widow of a dead soldier.Watch Myeshia Johnson s interview here:Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News
 Nursing Textbooks Recalled And Apology Issued For Racial Stereotypes Related To Pain Management,"Pearson, an educational publishing company, issued an apology on Thursday in regards to culturally insensitive material published in their textbook Nursing: A Concept-Based Approach to Learning. The section in question was titled  Focus on Diversity and Culture: Cultural Differences in Response to Pain  and contained theories on how to treat patients from different racial and religious backgrounds in regard to their ability and willingness to tolerate pain,The segment catagorized patients, or  clients  as they are referred to in the textbook, into six groups;  Arabs/Muslims , Asians ,  Blacks ,  Jews ,  Hispanics , and  Native Americans.  If the categories weren t cringe-worthy enough, it then gave the reader tips on how a  client s culture influences their response to and beliefs about pain.  Or, in other words, racial stereotypes. Among the shameless theories included in the piece were that  Blacks  will  often report higher pain intensity than other cultures  and that  Jews  can be  more vocal and demanding of assistance,  not a particularly scientific approach when the patient s feedback is the only way of evaluating and treating their suffering. Furthermore, if there were any truth to these allegations, which there is not, the textbook s approach would still be flawed, as many patients would fit into multiple categories, such as people from predominately Muslim countries in Asia.The material came to light after a Facebook user by the name of Onyx Moore posted a photo of the page in question and outrage ensued:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.10';  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));CN: Racism across the boardThis is an excellent example of how not to be even remotely culturally sensitive. These Posted by Onyx Moore on Monday, October 16, 2017In response to the attention and overall negative feedback Ms. Moore s Facebook post received,  Scott Overland, Pearson s communications director issued the following statement on Thursday: While differences in cultural attitudes towards pain are an important topic in medical programs, we presented this information in an inappropriate manner. We apologize for the offense this has caused and we have removed the material in question from current versions of the book, electronic versions of the book and future editions of this text. In addition, we now are actively reviewing all of our nursing curriculum products to identify and remove any remaining instances of this inappropriate content that might appear in other titles. We will continue to provide updates on our progress. This material does not reflect our values as a company and how we want to serve students. We always welcome feedback and we appreciate the concern shown by the students who raised this issue. The company also stated that they will recall all books with this particular segment printed in them, but as to how the material was published to begin with, Mr. Overland was less than certain.  We are working with our editorial teams as we speak to determine that,  he added.Featured image via Facebook",News
 Trump SCREAMS On Twitter After Seeing A Poll On Fox News,"Rex Tillerson was right. Donald Trump is a f*cking moron.After years of slamming polls as  fake,  Trump had the nerve to tout a poll on Sunday morning after Fox & Friends reported on it.The POLITICO/Morning Consult poll results show that 46 percent of respondents think the media fabricates stories about Trump.So, of course, the poll sent Trump to Twitter so he could literally scream about it and claim that his constant labeling of news outlets as  fake news  are  sinking through It is finally sinking through. 46% OF PEOPLE BELIEVE MAJOR NATIONAL NEWS ORGS FABRICATE STORIES ABOUT ME. FAKE NEWS, even worse! Lost cred.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2017Let s all keep in mind that this is ONE poll. Furthermore, the results were largely split down partisan lines, with 76 percent of Republicans believing that the news media make up stories about Trump. That number rises to 85 percent among Trump s most ardent supporters.If this poll had the opposite results, Trump would be dismissing it as a fake. And we all know it.Trump only thinks news stories and polls are accurate when they kiss his ass. That s why Fox & Friends is watched by Trump on a daily basis. They not only kiss his ass, they practically give him a blow-job every morning.Back in July, a PPP poll showed that a majority of Americans trust the news media more than they trust Trump.Over 50 percent of Americans said they trust NBC, CNN, ABC, the New York Times, and The Washington Post more than they trust Trump. The percentage of people who said they trust Trump more only hovered in the mid-30s.You know what else currently stands in the mid-30s? Trump s approval rating. The latest Gallup poll shows that only 35 percent of Americans approve of Trump s job performance. The Politico poll has it at 44 percent, so you can probably guess which poll Trump will call  fake.

 Trump And John Kelly Just Got RIPPED APART By A Medal Of Honor Recipient (VIDEO),"Donald Trump and his disgraceful team deserve to be throttled for their horrendous responses and disrespect to Gold Star families, particularly after Rep. Fredericka Wilson called Trump out on his insensitive remarks to the widow of a fallen soldier.After both Trump and his Chief of Staff, John Kelly, attacked Wilson and lied their a**es off to clear Trump s name, MSNBC anchor Joy Reid brought on a guest that would make Trump sorry he ever challenged Wilson. Noting that Wilson was currently at the funeral of fallen soldier La David Johnson while Trump was playing golf, Reid said: She is at that funeral as we speak. While General Kelly and his boss, Donald Trump, are still standing by their attacks on her. Like I said, extraordinary. Then, she turned to one of her guests, retired Colonel Jack Jacobs, and asked: Donald Trump likes to hide behind his generals, he likes to push them out front in order to give himself credibility. What do you make of General Kelly s willingness to be used in that way this week and then to add this extraneous story that turns up not even to be true slamming the congresswoman? It was as if Jacobs, a Medal of Honor recipient, had been waiting all day for the opportunity to rip Trump and Kelly apart. He said: Well, it s quite surprising because I know   I don t know him very well, I m not that close to him   but I know General Kelly I m quite surprised. Attacks like this don t make any sense from anybody. The retired colonel, who is also the recipient of two Silver Stars, three Bronze Stars, and two Purple Hearts, also stated that Trump and Kelly owed Wilson an apology: If it were I, I would. I mean, I d pick up the phone and say,  look, this has gone far enough, I apologize.  But that should have been the case from the very beginning when whatever is emanating from the White House was inaccurate as well. And the trashing continued with this brilliant attack: I can say this about Donald Trump, he s not real good at talking. If I were Trump, I would have picked up the phone and said,  look, that was my ham-handed way of being sympathetic, I m not good at that and I apologize.  And all this stuff would have been over. Another guest, a former combat veteran, agreed with Jacobs, while Reid reminded everyone that  It s not going to stop because Donald Trump this morning, got up bright and early and starting tweeting again attacking Congresswoman Wilson. So Donald Trump doesn t want it to end and he doesn t want the discussion to be about the fact it took him 13 days to call the families of these four fallen soldiers. He wants it to be about Congresswoman Wilson. Here s that tweet:As usual, Trump just makes things worse for himself. Jacobs was dead on when he stated that Trump could have easily ended this whole debacle by apologizing for his disgusting response and all the lies. But because he s Trump, we all knew that wasn t going to happen. Trump has gotten himself into this mess, and now he must pay the price.You can watch Jacobs crush Trump below: Featured image is a screenshot",News
 NRA Releases Fascist Ad Calling All Trump Critics â€˜Saboteursâ€™ Whose Future Is â€˜Failureâ€™ (VIDEO),"The First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees that we have the right to speak our minds about the government and anyone and anything else we damn well please. However, since Donald Trump was inaugurated, that right has been under attack. Trump is a thin-skinned, narcissistic bully who cannot take criticism, and his allies are now doing all they can to discredit anyone who dares to say a word against Trump. Of course, at the top of that list is the National Rifle Association (NRA), the terrorist organization that thinks that all these mass shootings and gun-related deaths are just the price of freedom.Therefore, it comes as no surprise that Dana Loesch, a spokeswoman for the organization, has just released a new advertisement video that can only be described as purely fascist. She attacks anyone and everyone who dares to criticize Trump as saboteurs who wish to take the victory of Trump and his base away. You see, to these people, those who do not support Trump are the REAL threat to the republic, not Trump s fascist, authoritarian regime. Loesch s statement culminates in the following chilling statement: From the highest levels of government, to their media, universities and billionaires, their hateful defiance of his legitimacy is an insult to each of us. So, educational institutions, the free press, anyone and everyone who sees the dangers of Trumpism   we must be dealt with. It comes complete with violent imagery and creepy music to boot. This is what fascism looks like, folks. Trump is turning America into North Korea before our very eyes. We better wake up and get him out of office before he declares martial law.

" Trump Takes Credit For Releasing JFK Files, But The Bill Requiring It Was Passed 25 Years Ago","Saturday morning, Trump was going through his usual routine of drinking six quarts of Red Bull while wistfully flipping through his Ivanka photo albums when a novel idea suddenly occurred to him. He raced to Twitter to let his eager followers know exactly what his plans were as the most powerful man in the world:Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2017That s right! Donald Trump will finally be opening that presidential book hidden in the Library of Congress (and found by Nicolas Cage) that contains all of the secrets passed down from president to president across the ages to reveal what really happened to JFK.Just kidding! Despite the fact that he tried to make it sound like it was his idea, and happening only under his authority, it turns out that the  JFK FILES,  as he so loudly put it, were scheduled to be released no later than next Thursday, October 26, 2017. Coincidentally, that date is exactly 25 years to the day after the  President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992  was passed by the 102nd Congress.Okay, I m kidding again. Democratic Senator and American hero John Glenn introduced the bill in July of that year   likely while production was wrapping up on Donald Trump s star cameo in the Hollywood blockbuster  Home Alone 2: Lost In New York. Especially relevant in the text of the bill is Section 2, which discusses the reasoning behind Senator Glenn s proposal of it.Isn t it weird, how Trump really emphasized the fact that the  JFK FILES  were  long blocked and classified  and that he was gonna do something about it? I mean, besides the fact that all he s actually doing is allowing an existing law to, uh, continue to exist and carry out as planned. No, what s weird is WHO  long blocked and classified  those files. John Glenn (who may or may not know the truth about the moon landing) was kind enough not to name the sitting president he was indicting in this bill for obstructing the files  release, but the math is pretty simple: From July to October of 1992, the entire time this bill was debated until its passage, the person referred to as  the executive branch  was former president (and even former-er CIA Chief) George H.W. Bush.A Republican. As usual.Anyway, thanks, Trumpykins! We really appreciate you, uh, not stopping this thing that was totally going to happen even if you d been hit by a meteor the day you admitted you were a sexual predator. I wonder how long the presidential records on all the crimes you ve committed since your inauguration will remain sealed.Featured image via Chris Kleponis (Pool)/Getty Images",News
 Bill Maher Takes Down Trumpâ€™s Lying Chief Of Staff In BLISTERING Rebuke (VIDEO)," White House Chief of Staff John Kelly is a Four Star Marine General who gave his son to this nation. That is why it was such a relief when he joined the Trump White House. Everyone thought he d bring order to a dangerously chaotic situation. However, as Donald Trump s attacks on Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-FL) in the midst of a Gold Star family s grief, General Kelly revealed his true colors. Instead of smoothing things over, he escalated the attacks, and actually lied about Rep. Wilson from the White House press podium. Well, one person isn t having any of this crap: Comedian and host of HBO s Real Time Bill Maher.During a blistering statement on his Friday night panel, Maher said of Kelly: He smeared and lied. He smeared that congresslady and he lied about it. He was supposed to be the Trump-minder, but now he acts like Trump. You can be this guy that everybody says  you are the man of unimpeachable integrity,  or you can take political hit shots and be the hatchet man. You can t do both. Maher is correct. Kelly s integrity is no longer unimpeachable, because he chose to utter provable lies from the White House press podium and has also chosen not to apologize for it. He defended the indefensible with regards to Trump s appalling statements to the Myeshia Johnson, the grieving widow of Army Sergeant La David Johnson. With that, Kelly smeared something that is supposed to be sacred, and he cannot take that back.I never thought I d say this about a man who has given so much to this country   including his own son   but here it is: Shame on you, John Kelly. You ve disgraced your position with what you have done. You should apologize to Sgt. Johnson s widow, and to the nation   and then you should resign.Watch Maher s remarks below:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News
 WATCH: Reporters DRAG Sarah Huckabee Sanders In Brilliant Fact-Check (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is having a hard time recovering from his fallen soldier debacle, not only because he continues to make it worse, but because America is tired of his nonsense and demands the truth.It was only yesterday that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly infuriated everyone by criticizing Rep. Frederica Wilson for calling Trump out for disrespecting a Gold Star widow. Kelly also went after Wilson for an old speech in 2015, stating that she d bragged about how she had gotten money for the FBI acknowledging two deceased agents. Little did Kelly know, this lie would ignite a sh*tstorm for the Trump administration.Earlier today, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was the unfortunate recipient of the media s frustration with the dishonest Trump administration. Reporters blasted Sanders with questions in the press briefing, directly pointing out that Wilson s FBI speech completely contradicted Kelly s claims. When a reporter boldly pointed out that Wilson had never boasted about funding in her speech, Sanders stumbled through her response: Absolutely, General Kelly was stunned that Representative Wilson made comments at a building dedication honoring slain FBI agents about her own actions in Congress, including lobbying former President Obama on legislation. As he pointed out, if you re able to make a sacred act like honoring American heroes all about yourself, you re an empty barrel. Or as we say in the South, all hat, no cattle. This was hardly the end for Sanders. Because she d defended Kelly despite being faced with facts that challenged his claims, reporters attacked her and asked if she d even seen the speech. Sanders claimed she had, and a reporter pointed out that she should know that Wilson actually praised the FBI agents and didn t talk about funding. Even as her spot was completely blown up, Sanders pathetically defended Kelly.The icing on the cake was when a reporter asked if Kelly would respond to more questions over the matter. When Sanders said he already had yesterday, the reporter pointed out: He was wrong yesterday! As usual, the Trump administration responded with intimidation and bullying. Sanders fired back: If you want to go after General Kelly, that s up to you. If you want to get into a debate with the four-star Marine general, I think that s something highly inappropriate. Go ahead. You can watch Sanders get grilled by reporters below:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News
 Swastika-Covered Guy Gets Punched In The Face Outside Nazi Rally And Itâ€™s Beautiful (VIDEO),"One Nazi made the mistake of leaving his  safe space  at a rally featuring infamous Nazi Richard Spencer and learned, like Spencer did at Donald Trump s inauguration, that most Americans hate his kind and just want to punch him in the face.Punching Nazis has been a controversial issue among liberals, with some saying we should hug it out with them and it will magically erase the hate and the rest of us agreeing with our family members who fought in World War II that if you see a Nazi you should probably punch him (my grandfather didn t leave most of his hip in Europe so I could hug Nazis back home, for instance)   and while some members of a crowd of protesters worked to escort the Nazi to safety, at least one person did the right thing and punched him in the f*cking mouth.The self-defense strike (no violence against a Nazi can be rightfully considered an attack) occurred at a rally in Gainesville, Florida when a man wearing a t-shirt covered in swastikas tried to walk past a group of anti-racism demonstrators.

 Trump Gets His A** Handed To Him By British Lawmakers For Lying About Rising Crime Rate In UK,"Donald Trump stuck his foot in his mouth again and pissed off our closest ally.A recent report indicates that the crime rate is rising in the United Kingdom due to gang-related activities and hate crimes against Muslims.Of course, rather than read the report to understand it, Trump took to Twitter to bellow about how  radical Islamic terror  is the cause and seemed to promote his Muslim ban as the way to  keep America safe! Just out report:  United Kingdom crime rises 13% annually amid spread of Radical Islamic terror.  Not good, we must keep America safe!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2017Trump s ridiculously uninformed commentary on the crime rate in the United Kingdom did not go over very well with British lawmakers, who promptly humiliated Trump with facts.Labour Party MP Chris Bryant told Trump to back off and reminded him that America has a massive gun violence problem. Butt out of it mister president,  Bryant said.  You have more murders in New York or Chicago every year than we do in the whole country so we re not going to take any lessons from you. Labour Party MP Stephen Doughty chimed in by telling the Daily Mail that Trump is  talking nonsense  and also took aim at Trump for not doing anything to stop mass shootings in America. Donald Trump would be better placed looking at issues in his own country such as the huge number of deaths from gun violence which despite repeated atrocities from Sandy Hook to Las Vegas, the US government have failed to take action on,  Doughty said.Liberal Democrat MP Jo Swinson slammed Trump as well, and went so far as to blame Trump s xenophobia for the rise in hate crimes. Hate crime is up and it is fueled by the kind of populist xenophobia you peddle,  she said.Needless to say, the British people were not happy about Trump s comments either.please don t mention us in your propaganda, we all hate you here.

" Trump Brags he Owns An â€˜Original Renoirâ€™, Yet The Real Painting Is Hanging In A Chicago Gallery","By now it s common knowledge that Donald Trump believes that anything that contradicts him is  fake,  but when it comes to a battle between a Chicago art gallery and the current President of the United States as to who owns the authentic painting of Two Sisters (on the Terrace) by the French Impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir, most would believe the original is hanging in the gallery, not the President s New York penthouse. Trump begs to differ.Two Sister, Pierre Auguste #Renoir #TwitArt #ArtLovers pic.twitter.com/dTKnNNbDly  Profesor Higgins (@HigginsProfesor) August 1, 2017Donald Trump s biographer, Tim O Brien, said recently in an interview that he first spotted the painting back in 2005 on Trump s private jet and decided to question him about it.  You know, that s an original Renoir,  O Brien said Trump told him. Donald, it s not,  was O Brien s reply.  I grew up in Chicago, that Renoir is called  Two Sisters on the Terrace , and it s hanging on a wall at the Art Institute of Chicago. That s not an original.  However, in his typical style, Trump repeated the very same claim the following day.Amanda Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Art Institute of Chicago, is also convinced that the gallery is in possession of the real deal, claiming that the painting was given to the Institute as a gift back in 1933 by Annie Swan Coburn. Coburn initially bought the painting for $100,000 from an art dealer by the name of Paul Durand-Ruel, who had purchased the piece directly from Renoir himself. Hicks added that the institute is satisfied that our version is real. The painting was visible in the background during an interview with 60 Minutes that was given in the President s penthouse suite in Trump Tower soon after his election victory among others, but more than just a handful of people are questioning the piece s authenticity. The painting has long been known and has, since its gift to the Art Institute of Chicago in 1933, been one of the treasures of the museum,  said Richard Brettell, chair of aesthetic studies at the University of Texas. Can President Trump own another version? From my trained eye looking at a pretty good photograph of Mrs. Trump in their penthouse at Trump Tower, it seems clearly to be a copy of that famous Chicago picture. Richard Rand, associate director for collections at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, California, whole-heartedly agrees.  While on rare occasions Renoir made variants of his painted compositions, he never copied himself or made precise duplicates of his oil paintings,  he said in an email.  If I were presented with a picture that was an exact copy of a famous Renoir hanging in a museum, I would guess it was probably a reproduction of some kind. But do any of these facts or expert opinions bother President Trump? His biographer doesn t think so. I m sure he s still telling people who come into the apartment,  It s an original, it s an original ,  Mr O Brien said. He believes his own lies in a way that lasts for decades. He ll tell the same stories time and time again, regardless of whether or not facts are right in front of his face. Featured image via Screenshot",News
 Richard Spencerâ€™s Fascist Goon Squad Couldnâ€™t Keep Florida From Laughing His Nazi Ass Off The Stage,"Oooh, big scary Richard Spencer! The milky-white wannabe hipster douchebag must have had a giant erection since Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency on Tuesday in advance of his appearance at the University of Florida in Gainesville.As everyone knows, the primary aim of the  alt-right    the modern-day Nazis responsible for the murder of Heather Heyer in Virginia in August   is to eliminate people of color in America, and then prove they don t actually have the tiny dicks they re surely packing. So every time someone seems scared of them, it s another boost to their ego.Fortunately, most people are in on the joke at this point, and state and local leaders have become more accustomed to the violence that neo-Nazi rallies bring with them. Even businesses have gotten in on trolling Richard Spencer and his pathetic band of white supremacist losers.Case in point: Alligator Brewing, a craft beer maker located in Tall Paul s Brewhouse in Gainesville had an amazing idea the other day   to allow anyone holding two tickets to Spencer s event at UF to come trade them in for a free beer: Ticket become available this Saturday, October 14th and each person can get two with a valid ID. This is our town. This is our home. Let s do this Gainesville.A post shared by Alligator Brewing (@alligatorbrewing) on Oct 12, 2017 at 3:56pm PDTThat didn t take long to go viral, of course, and Spencer s lackeys soon heard about it. They changed the ticketing process so that people couldn t get them in advance. They became available only in person at the event, according to the Miami Herald. A white supremacist sycophant of Spencer s, Cameron Padgett, told the paper that it was in an effort to  avoid the sabotage that was planned by people. Padgett himself then suddenly appeared at Tall Paul s, pretending to try and trade some tickets for beer. After he was told by Alligator Brewing that they couldn t verify the authenticity of his tickets (since the fascists changed their ticketing scheme), he became very belligerent and began filming from inside the bar: Please stay safe #lesshatemorebeerA post shared by Alligator Brewing (@alligatorbrewing) on Oct 18, 2017 at 3:34pm PDTNone of it was enough to keep the actual event from being a hilarious shitshow for Richard Spencer and his cast of racist clowns.It cost Spencer $10k to rent this hall.The tickets were free.At least 90% of the seats were empty or filled w/protestors.#SpencerAtUF https://t.co/uXc1gIcyul  Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) October 19, 2017These Pepe-loving asshats were literally laughed out of the room as protester after protester shut down their racist rhetoric.

LOL  FUCK NAZIS (@mariam0128) October 19, 2017Spencer s response was something along the lines of  European standards of beauty something something.  The crowd roared. When all was said and done, the would-be fuhrer admonished the crowd: You think that you shut me down. Well, you didn t. You failed at your own game the world is going to have a very different impression of the University of Florida. The world is not gonna be proud of you. You couldn t be more wrong, Spence.

 W. Virginia Halloween Store Boasts Shockingly Racist Costume Display Featuring Pres. Obama (VIDEO),"West Virginia is solid Trump country. The argument has been made that the opioid crisis, along with the  forgotten  population of white working class voters, is the reason for that state being overwhelmingly Trump Nation. However, there is one element that cannot be ignored here: Those same white working class voters also feature a lot of racists who hate President Barack Obama, and the ultimate way to stick it to him was to put Donald Trump in the White House.Well, it seems that putting Trump in power wasn t enough for these people. Even though the orange fascist has been steadily shredding the country, degrading the office of the presidency, emboldening our adversaries and scaring the hell out of our allies for nigh on a year now, these people simply cannot resist the temptation to attack President Obama in ever more stunningly racist ways. Case in point   a Halloween costume display in Spirit Halloween in Triadelphia, West Virginia.The display features an extremely racist depiction of President Obama in the form of a mask   complete with a watermelon costume in the same display, and banana costumes a shelf or two over, according to my friend and colleague John Prager, who shot the video of the shocking racism on the part of this retailer below:This just goes to show how racist certain people in this country are. This entire display is dripping with racist stereotypes, and it uses our first African American president s image to reinforce them. We need to confront this bigotry, rather than brushing it under the rug as  economic anxiety,  or whatever other excuses we ve been letting float out there for people voting for this despicable excuse for a human being. Trump is a crude, crass, rude, misogynistic bigot. There is not one excuse on the face of the earth for voting for a blatant white supremacist, and even less than that for continuing to excuse the behavior of so many of his voters.Shame on you, Spirit Halloween. It s time for a boycott, just in time for the best holiday of the year.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News
 New Report PROVES Voter Suppression Handed Trump Wisconsin And Possibly The Whole Election,"In a brand-new expos  on Mother Jones, investigative journalist Ari Berman delves into an aspect of the 2016 election that has been largely ignored in the shadow of controversies over internal DNC politics, shifting blame, and what is now known to be concrete Russian interference: Voter suppression.On the heels of a report Berman summarized back in September, his article for the November-December issue of the liberal stalwart magazine continues where he left off. Anecdotal evidence of individual voters who were prevented from voting in Wisconsin during the presidential election all adds up to a picture that explains the numbers in the University of Wisconsin-Madison study that Berman cites in his summary.The study, completed by UW-Madison s professor of Political Science, Kenneth Mayer, shows a survey in two large counties in Wisconsin that asked whether respondents were either prevented or deterred from voting in 2016 by the new Voter ID law in effect for the first time in that election. The results of the survey were stunning: More than 11 percent of respondents said they were deterred, and that 6 percent   more than half of the nonvoters   were prevented entirely. If those sound like small numbers, bear with me.In the course of research, voters were asked why they didn t vote, how engaged they were in the election, what types of ID they possessed, how confident they were in the final vote count, and their general demographics. The survey never required any respondent to answer who they may have voted for.Possibly the most distressing part of the findings was how disproportionately the Voter ID law affected low-income and minority voters: More than 21 percent of households under $25,000 of income per year were deterred; that number dropped to just over 7 percent for those above that line. The demarcation between white and black voters was even more stark, with just of 8 percent of white voters reporting trouble and 27.5 percent of African-Americans reporting the same.What does all that add up to?As Berman notes in the new piece for MJ, Wisconsin showed the second-highest voter turnout in the United States in both 2008 and 2012, but just four years later, participation was the lowest it had been in 16 years.So let s get back to those numbers.In just the two counties that were surveyed, Dane and Milwaukee, the percentage of registered voters who were adversely affected by the new Voter ID law represents a low estimate of nearly 17,000 and an upper estimate of 23,252 voters. In fact, the study points out, the 11.2 percent nonvoter estimate is actually low in itself, as it doesn t take into account voters who were deterred from even registering by the new law.If every single one of those in the study who answered that they were deterred or prevented from voting had actually cast a vote that counted, voter turnout would have increased by 2.24 percent. And that seems like an incredibly small number, until you extrapolate that across the state. The Wisconsin Election Commission estimated that 3.1 million voters turned out for the 2016 presidential election. That means 69,440 voters   under a conservative estimate   were disenfranchised entirely by the new Voter ID law.Donald Trump s margin of victory in the state? Less than a third of that.Given that the vast majority of disenfranchised voters, although they were not asked their political affiliations, were demographically more likely to vote for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump, it hardly requires extrapolation to conclude that, at least in the state of Wisconsin, Trump was right.The vote was rigged.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News
 WATCH: George W. Bush Calls Out Trump For Supporting White Supremacy,"Former President George W. Bush gave a speech on Thursday in which he said that  bigotry seems emboldened  in the U.S. and warned that Americans need to reject  white supremacy.  This is the speech that Trump should have given even before the Nazi march in Charlottesville. Donald Trump was backed by every white supremacist group across the board during his divisive campaign. Although Bush pointed to the  governing class,  he did not mention the former reality show star s name, but it was obvious that he was talking about Trump, his policies, and his base.Bush spoke of our  discourse being degraded by casual cruelty.  He continued to say that we ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism  and added that  we need to recover and recall our own identity. Discontent deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts  in recent years, Bush said in remarks from New York City at a forum focused on security and sponsored by the George W. Bush Institute. Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seem more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication,  the former President continued.Bush also warned against  a new era of cyber threats  including Russia s attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election, a thing which Donald Trump has called a hoax. Ultimately this assault won t succeed, but foreign aggressions including cyber attacks, disinformation, and financial influence should never be downplayed or tolerated,  he said. Bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed,  Bush continued.The Hill reports:Bush, who advocates free trade, promoted multilateral and bilateral trade deals during his presidency. Trump is now demanding that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico be renegotiated, under the threat of a U.S. withdrawal. We cannot wish globalization away,  Bush said, then he went on to urge society to  adapt  to economic and social change.Bush went on to warn that democracies face  new and serious threats  today.Economic, political and national security challenges  proliferate,  he said. And they re made worse by the tendency to turn inward,  he said.  The health of the Democratic spirit itself is at issue and the renewal of that spirit is the urgent task at hand. Our governing class has often been paralyzed in the face of obvious and pressing needs. The American dream of upward mobility seems out of reach for some who feel left behind in a changing economy,  he added.Watch:President George W Bush in NYC:  We ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism we need to recall and recover our own identity  pic.twitter.com/dsiSkFzEVp  Pat Ward (@WardDPatrick) October 19, 2017While Bush wasn t a great president, he wasn t an evil man (his vice-president was a doozy, though). Donald Trump is so bad for this country that he s making Bush seem like a reasonable president. And at least Bush knows how to form a coherent sentence. The former President has refrained from being in the public eye, but this speech needed to be made. We re sure he doesn t even recognize his own party anymore.Image via screen capture. ",News

 Trump HUMILIATED As WH Walks Back His Attack After Soldierâ€™s Mom Confirms His Insensitive Phone Call,"Donald Trump is having another bad day.Earlier this week, Trump finally contacted the family of one of the four American soldiers who were killed in Niger.Unfortunately, Trump was an asshole. He knew what he signed up for, but I guess it hurts anyway,  Trump told Army Sgt. La David Johnson s widow Myeshia over the phone while she and the rest of Johnson s family were meeting his flag-draped coffin.Florida Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson passed her account of Trump s insensitive words to the media. She was crying the whole time, and when she hung up the phone, she looked at me and said,  He didn t even remember his name.  That s the hurting part,  Wilson told MSNBC.  He was almost like joking. He said,  Well, I guess you knew    something to the effect that  he knew what he was getting into when he signed up, but I guess it hurts anyway.  You know, just matter-of-factly, that this is what happens, anyone who is signing up for military duty is signing up to die. That s the way we interpreted it. It was horrible. It was insensitive. It was absolutely crazy, unnecessary. I was livid. On Wednesday morning, Trump attacked Wilson and accused her of lying. Trump even claimed to have proof.Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2017As it turns out, Wilson has witnesses, including Johnson s own grieving mother, who confirmed Wilson s account to the Washington Post. President Trump did disrespect my son and my daughter and also me and my husband,  Cowanda Jones-Johnson said. She went on to confirm that Wilson s account was accurate.Faced with real proof, the White House was forced to walk back Trump s attack. This president cares deeply,  a White House official told the Sentinel.  Maybe he said something that was misunderstood, but he certainly cares about fallen servicemen and women. In short, the White House just basically confirmed that Donald Trump acted like an asshole toward Johnson s family, and also that Rep. Wilson was telling the truth.Trump owes her and Johnson s family a very public apology.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News

He has also neglected to call the families and when he contacted the widow of Army Sgt. La David Johnson he insulted her by telling her that  he knew what he was signing up for.

" Trump Finally Delivers On Promised Phone Call To Soldierâ€™s Wife, Says The Most Disgusting Thing EVER","After two days of controversy over Donald Trump s lack of response, attention, or even seeming to notice the four soldiers who died in an ambush in Niger nearly two weeks ago, he finally called the pregnant widow of one of the fallen soldiers, Sergeant LaDavid Johnson. At Miami International Airport, where she awaited the remains of her 25-year-old husband, Myeshia Johnson took the president s 5-minute call.On hand with Myeshia Johnson was Congresswoman Frederica Wilson, the US Representative from Johnson s district. Wilson has been critical of Trump s response   or lack of one   for longer than this has even been in the national spotlight. Sgt. Johnson s body was left behind after the ambush, and not recovered by the military for two days after the operation. Many questions remain about the ambush, the operation, and the planning that went into the entire effort. Some consider Trump s bluster on calling military families and his attack on President Barack Obama to be a distraction from those questions that have arisen.According to Rep Wilson, the phone call was  insensitive and insane,  and if accurate, what she conveyed from Sgt. Johnson s widow is possibly the worst thing anyone has ever said to the widow of a soldier, let alone the worst thing a president has said. Trump told Mrs. Johnson, He knew what he signed up for But when it happens it hurts anyway. Those are the words of a man who has either never suffered a loss or has never cared about one.The call was first reported by Ross Palombo, the Washington Bureau Chief for an ABC affiliate in Miami. After Palombo tweeted about the Congresswoman s account of the call, he was contacted by the White House, only for officials to chide him and tell him that the affair was none of his business:BREAKNG: Top White House official tells me about @realDonaldTrump comment to soldier s widow  The President s conversations with the families of American heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice are private.  @WPLGLocal10  Ross Palombo (@RossPalombo) October 18, 2017This kind of response is, unfortunately, just what America has come to expect from the disgusting Donald Trump and his cohorts in the White House.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News
 God Bless Whoever Is Photoshopping These Hilariously Long Ties Onto Donald Trump,"Every once in a while, the perfect pun comes along. You know them when you see them. They re so good, you have to come back and use them again and again. And in situations of discomfort, or fear, or even danger, a pun can be a lifesaver, or an icebreaker, or just something to remind everyone that not everything is serious all the time.Donald Trump presents America with those situations every day. And although there are plenty of good jokes and puns about his hair or his complexion or the likelihood that he has, um, nether regions that match his abnormally tiny hands, none of those are actually perfect. They re physical digs, and those are a dime a dozen.No, the funniest jokes about Donald Trump have to do with ironic things he does, like owning a brand of steaks and famously eating them in a way that makes Mr. Creosote himself, well, sick.But the funniest one of them all rolls right off the tongue because it s already a part of our everyday vernacular.

" Town Defends Official After Wifeâ€™s â€˜N*ggerâ€™ Rant On FB, Says People Who Shared Post â€˜Just As Badâ€™","This article is uncensored and contains very offensive language.The tiny town of Riverhead, New York, just across the Peconic Bay from The Hamptons, is on fire. No, not literally. It s not on fire like the California cities Donald Trump has seemingly forgotten about. But it wouldn t surprise me to find out that Trump knows more about Riverhead on Long Island than he does about Fountaingrove or Coffey Park in Santa Rosa. Especially now that officials are on their heels defending town attorney Bob Kozakiewicz and his wife, Dianne Delaney, after she posted possibly the most racially offensive rant I have ever seen.After visiting a local pizza parlor, Delaney took to Facebook to complain about the perceived treatment of her waitress by some black people   whether they were fellow patrons or employees is unclear   and it went south after just two sentences:Also unclear is how someone gets elected (yes, elected) town attorney without the deep-seeded racism clearly apparent in his family coming to light before now.Delaney is  just  the attorney s wife, so she will, of course, face no consequences. But Kozakiewicz is being defended by the town after some began calling for his resignation. Kozakiewicz and town supervisor Sean Walter blamed Delaney s rant on alcoholism, which may have played a part in the lack of inhibition required to publicly post something like that. But whether her uncensored feelings were set free by liquor or not, nobody but an unabashed racist could even come up with these things to say, drunk or sober.Kozakiewicz told his local paper Monday morning that his wife s  rant in no way, shape or form reflects my views.  That s an assertion that s slightly undercut by the fact that shortly before deleting his own Facebook page, the most recent post of his own was a share of a video by noted racist and  alt-right  Nazi Mike Cernovich:The town of Riverhead isn t quite ready to let Bob go, though. In addition to asking those following this story to  pray for Dianne,  town supervisor Walter laid equal blame at the feet of anyone who posted screen captures of the episode: It is unmitigated hatred that should never be reposted. If you see it and you repost it you re just as guilty in my opinion about propagating that hatred. So I guess I now share the blame for Dianne Delaney and her husband Bob being horrible, garbage humans.I can live with that if it eventually gets this asshole fired.Featured image via composite screen capture",News
 McCain Responds With Zero F*cks To Give Over Trumpâ€™s Threat,"Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz) went full-Maverick during an emotional speech Monday night after receiving the National Constitution Center s Liberty Medal. McCain appeared to target Donald Trump and his nationalist base. To fear the world we have organized and led for three-quarters of a century, to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain  the last best hope of earth  for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history,  McCain said in the speech.The Arizona senator continued to say that  we live in a land made of ideals, not blood and soil. That was just too much for the former reality show star to take.Trump warned the Arizona Republican, who has brain cancer, and served in the Navy for more than two decades and spent years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, that at some point he would  fight back  and added that  it won t be pretty. Trump, asked about McCain on @ChrisPlanteShow: ""I'm being very, very nice. But at some point I fight back, and it won't be pretty.""  Steven Portnoy (@stevenportnoy) October 17, 2017President Bone Spurs has been the recipient of multiple deferments and never served in the military, by the way.McCain responded to Trump s warning, saying,  I ve faced far greater challenges than this,  according to a CNN reporter.In response to Trump's threat, McCain had this blunt response: ""I ve faced far greater challenges than this"" https://t.co/nFo24e0dDe  Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) October 17, 2017In 2015, Trump attacked McCain for being a prisoner of war.  He s not a war hero,  Trump said at the time.  He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren t captured. McCain was repeatedly tortured while being held in a notorious North Vietnamese prison for about five and a half years. Two of those years were spent in solitary confinement. We re pretty sure Sen. McCain isn t breaking a sweat over the 71-year-old baby s threats.We don t have to always agree with McCain s politics to admire him.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.",News
 Man In â€˜I Stand For The National Anthemâ€™ Shirt Thinks American Flag Is A Lawn Chair,"You know how Trump supporters are screaming because brown people are protesting police violence and discrimination by peacefully kneeling for the National Anthem? Well, a photograph has surfaced that perfectly demonstrates the hypocrisy of the  fornicate with the flag  movement or whatever those screaming about it are calling themselves these days.Trump fans love to wave around their American flags while screaming  America First  but when you look at the respect conservatives actually show for their flag and country, you have to consider having a physician on standby to prevent you from dying of laughter.One right-wing  protester  wearing a shirt that says  I STAND FOR THE NATIONAL ANTHEM  was captured at a Jets game Sunday casually lounging on the same American flag he waves as he claims he s the biggest patriot in the history of patriotism with his trusty beer next to him.Deadspin reports that the person who snapped the photo saw the spectacle as they were walking with a friend through the stadium during the third quarter of the game. There is a huge tv screen by the food carts right inside the stadium where people gather to watch. We went over there to check it out and we saw him spread the flag out and sit down,  they said.  I thought it was too ironic so I snagged a picture. He sat on it for a few minutes before leaving. This is the reality of the  Patriots  on the Right. They talk a big game whenever they see a rainbow American flag or whenever an an African-American person is kneeling in front of one as the National Anthem plays. But when it comes to respecting the flag   well, you see what happens.Featured image via screengrab",News
" As â€˜Me Tooâ€™ Posts Flood Social Media, Video Surfaces Of Trump Bragging About Hiring A â€˜HOTâ€™ Teenager","Everyone knows what a dirtbag Donald Trump is when it comes to women. His wives, his ex-wives, his mistresses, and even perfect strangers could literally all be participating in the #MeToo posts going on right now on Facebook and Twitter.The movement really took off after a tweet by actress Alyssa Milano:If you ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write  me too  as a reply to this tweet. pic.twitter.com/k2oeCiUf9n  Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) October 15, 2017Sophie Gilbert wrote an excellent piece in The Atlantic about the use of the tag to draw attention to the fact that not some, not many, but most women have had to endure some sort of sexual harassment in their everyday lives, and most of them many, many times.But in the middle of it all, another tweet came across the feeds of at least Scott Dworkin s quarter of a million followers on Twitter Monday morning. It s a recently uncovered video of Donald Trump back in 2007 giving a highly-paid speech to the Learning Annex. In it, a woman named Juliet in the audience at one point raises her hand during the Q&A portion of the event, and asks Trump, How many jets do you have and how might I apply to be a flight attendant? Seizing the opportunity to be the jackass he s been his whole life, skeevy Donald has the lovely young woman escorted to the stage. As she approaches, his face contorts into  appreciative  looks and he tells the audience,  I think she s hired, I don t know.  Leering at her body, he puts his arm around her and says, deadpan, You re hired. Trump then proceeds to tell the audience a story. I had a case, it was very interesting. A beautiful girl who was 17 or 18 and applied to be a waitress. So beautiful. She s like a world-class beauty like the young lady who just asked a question about the actress. She s so beautiful. And my people came and she said,  Mr. Trump, she has no experience.  So I interviewed her anyway because she was so pretty. And I said,  Let me ask you, do you have any experience?  She goes,  No, sir.  I say,  When can you start?' Before Juliet can leave the stage, presumably having been brought on purely as a prop for his anecdote, he squeezes her and kisses her. Then he stares at her body as she leaves the stage. This isn t my  interpretation  of what Trump is doing, you ll see in the video yourself. And as if making faces, raising his eyebrows, pursing his lips as he watches her walk away isn t enough, he turns back to the microphone and explains his  addiction  to women: See now, if she worked on my plane, that s like a death wish for me, right? That s like an alcoholic. People are alcoholics. You put Scotch in front of them, it s like [Trump waves his hands around the way he did while making fun of a disabled reporter], it s like, this would be my form of alcoholism. It is so sad that the biggest trend on social media right now is people sharing their stories of abuse publicly, just to spread awareness about how pervasive the problem is  And the country is being led by one of the biggest, most public perpetrators of that kind of abuse the world has ever known.Watch the video here:Featured image via Leon Neal/Getty Images",News
" Robert De Niro Attends Charity Event, Tears Into That â€˜Motherf***erâ€™ Donald Trump","Acclaimed actor Robert De Niro doesn t hold back when it comes to former reality show star Donald Trump and last night was no different. While appearing at the Annual Hudson River Park Gala in Manhattan, New York, the event saw the esteemed actor honored and a bench dedicated to him, according to The Independent. The seven-time Academy Award nominee, who also won two Oscars, tore into that  lowlife  Donald Trump and that was just the beginning. One of my pleasures will be keeping people off my bench who don t deserve a view of the park like Donald Trump,  he said during a speech. F k you, Donald Trump. It s a horror with this motherf er.  The  Good Fellas  actor then went on to describe Trump as a  low life. Former Mayor Mike Bloomberg deadpanned about the famously shy actor, according to the Daily News.  It took me years before I finally got a sentence out of Bobby. He s not a big talker. Well, Mr. De Niro isn t shy anymore. During the 2016 campaign, he said,  I d like to punch Donald Trump in the face  and called him  blatantly stupid. Earlier this year, Mr. De Niro called Trump a  flat-out blatant racist , and added,  If he was smart, he d be even more dangerous. He s dangerous as it is. He s not wrong. Trump has tried on several occasions during his usual Twitter outbursts to start a war with North Korea while throwing any attempts of diplomacy out the window. The Paris Accord? Pfft! He s consistently done away with anything that has President Barack Obama s name attached to it even if it s to the detriment of our country and/or the world. Trump s profound jealousy of his predecessor was obvious long before he started his campaign and now that he was elected by conservatives touting Pepe the Frog memes in their avatars, Trump is guided solely by his feeling of inadequacy toward Obama.Good on you, Mr. De Niro. Sometimes things just have to be said.Photo by William D. Bird/Getty Images",News
 Satanists Brilliantly Troll Anti-Gay Baker By Requesting A Birthday Cake For Lucifer (VIDEO),"Christian cake baker Jack Phillips gained national infamy when he violated Colorado s non-discrimination law by refusing to bake a cake for a gay couple s wedding. He was subsequently sued, and now his case is headed to the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, with the current makeup of the court and Donald Trump s administration in place, it is quite likely that discrimination will be codified into law. Nonetheless, The Satanic Temple has come up with a brilliant way to point out that religious freedom cuts both ways: By having these bigoted bakers make cakes for Satan.Jack Phillips has already had his first request via email from a Satanist seeking to celebrate Satan. It reads:Dear Mr PhillipsI would like to get a quote on a birthday cake, for a special event. It is a cake that is religious in theme, and since religion is a protected class, I am hoping that you will gladly bake this cake. As you see the birthday cake in question is to celebrate the birthday of Lucifer, or as they are also known Satan who was born as Satan when he was cast from heaven by God. The cake only needs to be a simple 9 13 single layer cake, with red and black icing. As well as to contain an upside down cross, under the head of Lucifer. And I thought I would seek you out, to bake this cake since you appear to be a very moral person since you refused to bake a cake for same sex couples. And since religion is a protected class, I hope you will be willing to bake this cake, so my small group of religious friends can celebrate the birthday of Lucifer this coming November, just a few days after Halloween.Sincerely,(Name redacted)Here is a sample cake posted to Twitter by The Satanic Temple s co-founder, Lucien Greaves:Did you know: bakers can't refuse service to The Satanic Temple because religion is a ""protected class""? #SatanCakes pic.twitter.com/9VrVndkbSi  Lucien Greaves (@LucienGreaves) September 26, 2017The whole point here is not to torment bakers or anyone else. It is to point out that if you own a business that is open to the public, you may not discriminate, period. Now, at the federal level there are no non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people. However, religion   EVERY religion   is a protected class. If Jack Phillips or anyone else refuses the Satanists their cakes, this will be an open and shut court case.Mr. Phillips, it would have been a hell of a lot easier if you had just baked the damn wedding cake.Here is video of the Temple s co-founder explaining his position:Featured image via video screen capture",News
" FCC Rebukes Trump, Refuses To Dismantle First Amendment Over His Petty Tantrums","Donald Trump has recently come under fire for his most autocratic charge yet, which is that the free press should be regulated for writing bad things about him. He even mentioned somehow getting rid of their licenses.Fake @NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a ""tenfold"" increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal. Pure fiction, made up to demean. NBC = CNN!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2017Jessica Rosenworcel, a commissioner for the Federal Communications Commission, says of Trump s tweets challenging the rights of the free press: I think it s essential that the FCC and all that it does is careful to abide by the First Amendment when it engages in any kind of policies involving broadcast licensees. Rosenworcel went even further when she was questioned about Trump s suggestions that the First Amendment should somehow be impeded from the bully pulpit of the White House: I think it s important to realize that the Supreme Court characterizes our First Amendment as a profound national commitment to having robust, uninhibited and wide open debate and you know, that debate can sometimes be hard hitting for public officials. But it is absolutely essential that we support the first amendment and everything that the FCC does. She went on to say that it is the duty of other FCC commissioners and employees to go public and defend the First Amendment,  no matter what Trump does or says. Rosenworcel made clear what she thought of what the media should do in regards to Trump s tantrums and dissatisfaction with journalists speaking truth to power: I think it s important for all the commissioners to make clear that they support the First Amendment. And that the agency will not revoke a broadcast license simply because the president is dissatisfied with the licensees coverage. Hopefully others in the FCC feel the same way. Donald Trump is taking the first steps to turn America into an autocracy or a dictatorship, and we should not tolerate his antics. In fact, our resisting them could save the republic.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News

 WATCH: Van Jones Scorches Insane Republican Who Thinkâ€™s Trumpâ€™s Chaos Helps His Agenda,"Donald Trump is an extreme narcissist who always demands unwavering loyalty from his cable news surrogates. No matter how outrageous his words or deeds,  Therefore, it comes as no surprise that during an appearance on ABC s This Week, Matt Schlapp, Chairman of the American Conservative Union actually suggested that Trump s chaotic excuse for governing the nation is actually helping move the GOP legislative agenda alone.First, former conservative radio host and #NeverTrump Republican Charlie Sykes was able to weigh in, saying: The role that the president is playing, rather than showing leadership of any kind, he is sowing chaos, confusion and destruction. Schlapp said in response: I get the fact that there s an opinion on Donald Trump that a lot of people don t like Donald Trump. The president does want to get it done but he wants to get it done within the context of the other aspects of these polices. So Dreamers are going to have to be accompanied with border security. And [Obamacare] CSR payments are going to have to be accompanied by other health care reforms. That s where the very outspoken Van Jones chimed in: You just described probably the most complicated set of negotiations in the history of the republic, that this guy is ramming through. Schlapp tried to cut Jones off, but Jones wasn t having it, and plowed on: I m not finished yet, I m not done. The problem you are having is what you are describing is something that would require real leadership, real finesse. On BOTH sides!  Schlapp desperately pouted.Jones calmly continued: I ll say on both sides. But your guy, who you are going to love and defend   I understand it s your job   you have to admit he s his own worst enemy. In order to do what you just described, you would need discipline and focus. That s when Jones really let the bomb drop: That this isn t normal, and Senator Bob Corker started openly questioning Trump s stability and fitness to serve. Jones said: We are so into the crazy now, when something significant happens, we don t notice. [Corker] is not a bomb thrower. And when someone of his stature and his temperament says World War III, that should be a all-cars-stop-on-the-interstate moment. What is going on? Van Jones is correct. This is a very dangerous situation, and Trump s cable news lackeys are enabling this playing of Russian Roulette with our lives and the future of the nation. If we land in a nuclear war, you know who to blame   it s the Matt Schlapp s of the world, not the Van Joneses.Watch the incredible conversation below.",News
 Hustler Owner Is So Fed Up With Trump That He Is Offering $10 Mill For Dirt To Get Him Impeached,"Donald Trump is a danger to the nation and the world.

Of course, Senator Corker isn t the only one who is deeply concerned about Trump. Well, one person is actually willing to put his money where his mouth is in order to get The Donald removed   literally.Hustler Magazine owner Larry Flynt has taken out an advertisement on Twitter offering up $10 million dollars for the goods on Trump   particularly those bits of information that would unequivocally be evidence that he must removed from the White House.

Flynt goes on to say: Impeachment would be a messy, contentious affair, but the alternative   three more years of destabilizing dysfunction   is worse. Both good Democrats and good Republicans who put country over party did it before with Watergate. Flynt is offering this kind of cash that would leave the recipient set for life because he reminds us all that getting rid of Trump would mean  unimpeachable evidence  needs to be revealed to the Congress and to the public.Someone out there knows the dirt on Trump.

" Trump Administration Tries To Fix His Dumbest Statement Yet, Fails MISERABLY (IMAGE)","Donald Trump s administration is probably the most stressed out team the White House has ever seen. While dealing with multiple ethical issues and investigations, the administration never gets a day of rest as they are in constant reaction mode and doing damage control on his constant blunders. Today was the perfect example of an administration that is hanging on by a thread.Earlier today, Trump displayed his blatant stupidity as he gave a speech at the conservative Values Voter Summit. During that speech, Trump shocked over 3,000 attendees (and the world) when he said he d met with the  president of the Virgin Islands.  This was Trump s direct quote: I went to Puerto Rico, and I met with the president of the Virgin Islands, these are people that are incredible people. They ve suffered gravely, and we ll be there. We re gonna be there. We have, really, it s not even a question of a choice   we re going to be there as Americans. Trump apparently doesn t know that HE is the president of the Virgin Islands, because the islands are a part of American territory! As expected, Twitter dragged Trump for this: There s really no way to gracefully fix this, but still the Trump administration had to try. In a half-ass, hilarious attempt to minimize Trump s very obvious f*ck up, the White House released a transcript of Trump s remarks   and crossed out the word  president  and replaced it with the correction of  governor of the Virgin Islands.  CNN s Kaitlan Collins made sure to share this with everyone:It s like the Trump administration didn t even try to be subtle! And how could they? Just as they put out one fire, Trump is making five more.

" After Whining About NFL â€˜Disrespect,â€™ Trump Laughs And Jokes During Military Ceremony","After weeks of blubbering on Twitter and into every microphone he could find about how un-American NFL players who kneel during the national anthem are, Donald Trump just did the un-American equivalent of drunkenly slapping his dick on the table in the middle of a black-tie dinner.During a self-congratulatory interview with his number one sycophant, Sean Hannity, Trump found himself absolutely bewildered by a military ceremony that his supporters have been breathlessly posting on Facebook and referring to as  what respect for the military looks like : The playing of  Retreat  on the bugle. The song is played as the American flag is brought down the pole at the end of the day and secured for the night.The Commander-in-Chief of nine months had no idea what was happening as the song began to play. As it begins, he first jokes with the human pile of shit he s sitting across from, then turns to play to the audience: What a nice sound that is. Are they playing that for you or for me? They re playing that in honor of his ratings! Did you see how good his ratings were? He s beating everybody! Now, it s not like Donald Trump was  in uniform  as the official leader of America s military while he sat there with the second-biggest* asshole on television. But the fact remains that it s his title, especially in a setting where servicemembers are present. One military newspaper, Georgia s Fort Gordon Globe, describes expected behavior like so:Screen captureI think you ll note I didn t describe Donald Trump doing anything even close to any of that whatsoever as the bugle played its end-of-day call. You can watch for yourself:Complete ignorance of military custom is nothing less than exactly what I would expect out of hypocritical Donald Trump. He s been freaking out about NFL players   who are protesting for their very lives   silently kneeling or sitting during the national anthem for weeks now. He s appealed to their bosses, he s attempted to turn America against them, and he s generally been the most racist asshat on the planet about the whole process.Now we see that his offense at the NFL protests had nothing to do with patriotism, but with trying to dictate where and when it was okay for black people to protest.*the biggest asshole on television without question is Pat RobertsonFeatured image via Stephen Chernin/Getty Images",News

 Puerto Ricoâ€™s Governor Pleads For Help After Trump Threatens To Abandon Recovery Efforts,"Donald Trump took his angry little fingers to his Twitter account Thursday morning, threatening to abandon recovery efforts in Puerto Rico where the majority of the hurricane-devastated island s residents remain without power, water and food.Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello immediately responded on Thursday to President Trump s warning, saying that the U.S. territory s residents are only asking for the same assistance that other Americans would receive. You know, like in Texas and Florida, two states which helped bring Trump to power. And yet, Trump did not issue threats to those states. The U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico are requesting the support that any of our fellow citizens would receive across our Nation,  Rossello tweeted.The U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico are requesting the support that any of our fellow citizens would receive across our Nation.  Ricardo Rossello (@ricardorossello) October 12, 2017Some Puerto Rican officials, like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul n Cruz, have pleaded for help, but in return, she received a backlash of hate from the amateur president who called her  nasty.

Trump added:  These are great people. We want them to be safe and sound and secure. And we will be there every day until that happens.

 Trump Finalizes Betrayal Of LGBT Community With First Speech To Hate Group By A President,"After a campaign in which he shamelessly pandered to the LGBT community, Donald Trump has betrayed them so completely that his prior rhetoric is all but unrecognizable. He is slated to speak at the  Values Voters Summit  on Friday, hosted by the hate group Family Research Council and their extremist president Tony Perkins, a man who believes that gays should be put to death.The speech Trump gave at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July 2016 came just one month after the deadly shooting at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando Florida. That hate crime, sometimes referred to as a terrorist attack based on the religion of the perpetrator, claimed the lives of 49 mostly Latino gay club-goers and wounded 58 more. It was the first time Facebook s Safety Check feature was ever used inside the United States, with users marking themselves as  safe  to let family and friends know they were okay.Although witnesses at Pulse said they remembered the attacker being a patron of the bar   perhaps a jilted lover, even   Trump took the opportunity in that Cleveland speech to make a vow to his LGBT voters:  As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology.  And what did those voters look like?Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty ImagesThey looked like kids who believed him.The man who became the first Republican to even mention the LGBT crowd at a national convention went on to reverse himself in every way possible.He had already said earlier that year that transgender people should use  the bathroom that they feel is appropriate.  At a Colorado rally in October, Trump waved a rainbow flag with the phrase  LGBTs For Trump  scrawled across the middle.But all of his promises, all of his platitudes, were meaningless.He unilaterally made the decision to expel transgender soldiers from the military, then lied about it, saying that he had consulted with military leaders about the issue. He revoked Obama-era bathroom guidelines that favored the community in public schools. He went so far as to remove the entire section on LGBTQ rights from the official White House website.Now that Trump s Justice Department, under the bigoted tutelage of notoriously anti-gay asshole Jeff Sessions, has asserted that it is legal to actually discriminate against transgender employees, you d think that Donald Trump would make sure the statement on the White House site in which he vowed to uphold protections for them would be taken down out of shame, or at least consistency. He can t be bothered.So what does it mean that Trump is the very first president to speak at the Values Voters Summit? It means that his hypocrisy has come full circle. It means that his lies are all finally exposed. It means that he is shameless enough to not only adopt religion in order to solidify his base, but to pander to even the extremist wing of that religion, even if they openly advocate for the persecution of the community Donald Trump once promised to protect.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News
" Trump Just Made A Major Threat To The Press, Jake Tapperâ€™s Response Is Perfect (VIDEO)","It s pretty clear that Donald Trump has no idea how the country works, or what is actually in the US Constitution.Earlier today, Trump attacked NBC News for reporting unflattering   but true   content about him. The network had first infuriated Trump several days ago when it reported that his Secretary of State had called him a  moron , and most recently the network enraged Trump again by reporting on the reason Rex Tillerson called Trump a moron   which was because Trump wanted to increase the US nuclear arsenal tenfold. For no other reason than because his fragile ego can t handle it, Trump reacted to that story by threatening to take away the press  broadcasting license.Trump made things even worse as the day went on when he actually said,  It s frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write, and people should look into it. Understandably, there was a huge uprising in opposition to all of this, with one of the most brilliant responses coming from CNN s Jake Tapper. During the opening of his show The Lead, Tapper responded to Trump by telling him to go read the Constitution.

" WATCH: House Dem Has Had ENOUGH, Formally Starts Impeachment Proceedings Against Trump","Donald Trump is a clear and present threat to the United States of America. That fact is indisputable at this point; after all, a Senator in his own party just said so in strikingly blunt terms. However, the GOP-controlled House has been silent on Trump s dangerous antics, because they fear his lighting them up on Twitter, and they also fear retaliation by his crazy base at the ballot box. But it seems that Rep. Al Green (D- TX) has had enough.On Wednesday afternoon, Rep. Green took the floor of the House of Representatives and formally introduced Articles of Impeachment against Trump. Green began: I rise today on behalf of the many who have concluded that enough is enough. Green went on to say that Trump s being in the White House is is fueling an alt-right hate machine,  which is currently  causing immediate injury to American society.  On top of that, Green introduced his Articles as  privileged,  meaning  that the House needs to take them up within the next two days.Now, obviously this will go nowhere. Those craven Republicans don t care that Trump is destroying the country, just as long as they get every bigoted right-wing fever dream they ve had for the last eight years codified into law, with a few tax cuts for rich people thrown in, oh, just for fun.In short, these Republicans KNOW that Trump is unfit, and could even land us in a nuclear holocaust if he can t be kept away from the nuclear codes. In fact, at this point, any responsible person will do what was done to President Nixon in his final days, when he reportedly was drinking heavily and wandering the halls of the White House conversing with portraits of dead presidents. At that time, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and soon-to-be President Gerald Ford insisted that those responsible for launching nuclear weapons went through them rather than Nixon, because they knew Nixon to be dangerous.General John Kelly, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and other adults in the room had better be doing the same with Trump, who is MUCH more dangerous than Nixon ever dreamed of being.Please, someone show some courage in the Republican House and go along with Rep. Green. It s time to impeach Trump.Watch Rep. Green s remarks below:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty images",News
 Trump Threatens To Shut Down NBC In Early Morning Hissy Fit,"It s time to drag Donald Trump out of office. Because if we don t act soon, the Constitution will be put through a shredder.NBC News has multiple reliable sources. And when those sources tell them something, they pass the information on to the public, whether Trump approves or not.That s because the free press in this country do not answer to a petty tyrant who thinks he should have a say in what the media reports.In response to reports concerning General John Kelly and growing tension between him and Trump, Trump lashed out on Twitter.The Fake News is at it again, this time trying to hurt one of the finest people I know, General John Kelly, by saying he will soon be ..

Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2017It should be pointed out that the unemployment rate was already under 5 percent and declining, while the stock market had already reached record highs and climbing before the 2016 Election. Trump has not even passed a budget of his own yet and has not signed a single piece of economic legislation. However, the economic regulations he has killed has resulted in the first monthly job losses after over 70 straight months of growth.Trump then exploded in rage against NBC for reporting on Trump s desire to dramatically expand America s nuclear arsenal, and threatened to strip them of their broadcasting license.Fake @NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a  tenfold  increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal. Pure fiction, made up to demean. NBC = CNN!  Donald J.

Conservatives would be losing their minds and accusing him of violating the right to free speech and freedom of the press.If Donald Trump follows through on this threat, however, the next Democrat to hold the White House should retaliate by immediately yanking Fox News  broadcasting license.

 White House Confirms Resident Nazi Stephen Miller Is An Even Bigger Scumbag Than You Knew,"White house Nazi Stephen Miller is a scumbag. At this point, there s no question about it. He s a Nazi and therefore is a scumbag.But there are other reasons Miller is a piece of trash outside of his struggle, or kampf, with people remembering his long history of riding the white rage train to the White House, spouting Nazi dog-whistle terms like  cosmopolitan  (it means Jew, in case you re unaware) when insulting opponents.Miller, whose family mostly seems to hate him based on their social media remarks, is now beset by the FAKE NEWS fake newsing up some more fake news about oh, the White House confirmed this one?The New York Times reports that in high school Miller showed his contempt for women by leaping into the final stretch of a race they had been running for quite some time:Mr. Miller set off on a patriotic semi-striptease before the editor of the student newspaper, according to the editor, Ari Rosmarin, theatrically removing a button-down to reveal an American flag T-shirt in protest of an article he found inconsistent with the national interest. (The White House denied any symbolic unbuttoning, though officials confirmed Mr. Miller s fondness for the T-shirt.)He jumped, uninvited, into the final stretch of a girls  track meet, apparently intent on proving his athletic supremacy over the opposite sex. (The White House, reaching for exculpatory context, noted that this was a girls  team from another school, not his own.)Miller apparently hoped to take advantage of this  head start  to show that he is genetically superior to women by crossing the finish line first (this, of course, perfectly matches his current professed views on women).Donald Trump hires only the best people.Featured image via screengrab",News
 FEMA: Itâ€™s â€˜Not Our Jobâ€™ To Deliver Food And Water Relief To Puerto Rico,"If you re sitting at your computer, take a deep breath. If you re reading this on your phone, have a seat. Everything you think you know about how bad the Trump administration s response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico has been is about to get a whole lot worse.On Rachel Maddow s show Monday night, she discussed a small town in the mountains of Puerto Rico called Aibonito, roughly one and a half hours from the capital city of San Juan. If it seems like you re getting a geography lesson lately, that s good   even if it is because of listening to Trump trash talk mayors and citizens or watching him pelt churchgoers with rolls of paper towels.Showing video taken from a moving vehicle, Rachel describes the roads from the capital to Aibonito: Clear. Unblocked. As the cameras travel with the MSNBC team, you hear the point of Rachel s report, which is that after almost three weeks since the storm, FEMA still has not brought relief to the mountain town. And to hear them tell it, there s a reason.It s not their job.FEMA still has not delivered food or water to the completely accessible town. And make no mistake, FEMA knows that Aibonito is accessible at this point, because they ve been there three times. All three times, FEMA was on the scene to  help residents fill out paperwork  to apply for aid. Let s drag that acronym out into what it stands for: The Federal Emergency Management Agency. Heading to a remote mountain town that s been waiting three weeks for food and water to assist the pueblo in asking for help doesn t sound like anyone is managing any emergencies to me.Rachel first ran a profile on Aibonito on Friday, which is how she knew that FEMA had been there three times. After she ran that report, FEMA contacted her show, desperate to let the public know that they had once again made the literally unimpeded journey to Aibonito on Saturday, this time to speak to the mayor and file a report on the needs of the community. Still no food or water in their undoubtedly spacious trucks.The death toll in Puerto Rico has more than doubled since Donald Trump told the residents there that they should be grateful so few had died.But the part that will piss you off is the comparison between how the Trump administration has handled this  emergency management  as opposed to the emergencies in Texas and Florida. Shipping restrictions are back in place in Puerto Rico, making what little aid is coming hard to receive. The administration initially refused to lift a restriction on using food stamps to purchase ready-to-eat food, despite the grocery stores on the island being mostly closed until within the last week, and despite those stores that have reopened jacking up their prices. That s not how it went in the mainland US, where the  white people s hurricanes  saw victims able to use their food stamps to purchase McDonald s on day one, and where the federal government stepped in to help municipalities fight price gouging.There can be little doubt that the  emergency management  in Puerto Rico has suffered from a lack of compassion, and that erasing everything that puertorrique os have in common with Texans and Floridians   American citizenship, basic humanity, dire need   what s left is that they are a Spanish-speaking people. They are brown and seem foreign. They are underdogs, with a flag that isn t the same shape as the flags of the individual United States that fly at the same height: Just below the American flag.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News
 Trump Just Asked The Most Unqualified Person Ever To Join His NAFTA Renegotiation Team,"Trump, who keeps promising to either scrap our trade deals, or at least aggressively renegotiate them, is mulling over all the people he could add to his NAFTA renegotiating team. He s apparently not looking for anyone who has diplomatic negotiating experience though, since he thinks negotiating is negotiating. Noooo he actually wants Ron Burkle, co-owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins, on this team because he believes Burkle is great at negotiating.The Penguins were visiting the White House in the tradition of champion sports teams, where Trump praised Burkle s negotiating abilities and said: Ron, how about negotiating some of our horrible trade deals that they ve made? Here s what I want, I want to get him. Oh, I would love to have Ron Burkle. And it s great to have you Ron. But I really mean that, if you want to get involved in negotiating NAFTA, I like it. Because we re renegotiating NAFTA, Ron. The U.S. is entering its fourth round of NAFTA talks, with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s visit to the U.S. tomorrow overlapping that. Trump hates NAFTA in part because he wants trade deals that are heavily even unfairly weighted in our direction. He has threatened to walk away from these talks because he s not getting what he wants.Worse, like the Paris Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he thinks terminating our involvement in international agreements is the best way to get his idea of a good deal: I happen to think that Nafta will have to be terminated if we re going to make it good. Otherwise, I believe you can t negotiate a good deal. Said the desert to the grain of sand. This is a man who has bankrupted so many businesses and hurt so many people that way that it s astonishing anyone thinks he s a great businessman. But hey, he made out nicely, so who cares what happened to everyone else?This is how he sees our international agreements, including NAFTA. He doesn t understand international diplomacy at all and doesn t care to   so honestly, is it any wonder he wants the co-owner of a hockey team to work on this? He s going to destroy our economy if he doesn t get other countries to destroy us with nukes first.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News
 GOP Lawmaker: Republicans Are Freaking Out About The â€˜Dysfunctionâ€™ In The White House (VIDEO),"Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) is being defended by one of his Republican colleagues following Donald Trump s attacks on the Tennessee Republican. Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA) said that Republicans in the Senate and House are frustrated with Trump and added Monday on MSNBC,  We have these conversations all the time. We ve had a lot of these  the emperor has no clothes  moments and I m glad that Sen. Corker has brought voice to this,  Dent said.  We are concerned. My colleagues, my Republican colleagues in the House, I know, and Senate, are concerned by much of the dysfunction and disorder and chaos at the White House. Dent noted that since John Kelly became chief of staff that tensions have eased  a bit  but added that the constant  insults  and  sideshows  distract Congress from focusing on policy. We have these conversations all the time and we have to do better and I think more of my colleagues should speak up,  he said.  They say things privately, they don t say publicly. I said it publicly before I announced I wasn t running. Corker, who is leaving office, called the White House an  adult day care center  and said that Donald Trump is putting the U.S. on the  path to World War III. When you re the President of the United States, your words are policy. People take those words very seriously, and I don t think the President has learned that yet,  Dent said, according to Talking Points Memo.  The President, I believe, has to be much more measured in his rhetoric, but good luck with that. Watch:Sens. Jeff Flake and John McCain have also been critical of Trump s chaotic administration. In return, Trump fires back at them, typically on his Twitter account. There s a price to pay if a politician dares to criticize the thin-skinned president who is putting us on the path to World War III. For example, just this morning, Trump lashed out at Corker by taking a shot at the Tennessee Republican s height.  Because it s 2017 and we re witnessing a dysfunctional reality show.Image via screen capture.",News
 Trump EXPLODES In Twitter Tantrum That Proves Heâ€™s Mentally Unfit To Be President,"Donald Trump threw a massive hissy fit over just about everything on Tuesday morning.Some things just do not need to be commented on by the president, but for some reason, Trump thinks he needs to comment on everything.In a series of whining tweets, Trump took petty shots at Democrats, ESPN, Jemele Hill, the NFL, and Senator Bob Corker that perfectly demonstrate how thin-skinned and how pathetically unfit he is to be president.He began by threatening the NFL for not punishing players who exercise their right to free speech.Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country?

 Black Man Beaten By Nazis At Pro-Trump Rally So Naturally Cops Charged HIM With A Crime,"When Deandre Harris was beaten by a mix of white supremacist Trump supporters, Nazi Trump supporters, racist Trump supporters, and Trump supporters who don t subscribe to any particular single white power group, at a Nazi rally in Charlottesville, his life was changed forever.Not only was this young man forced to deal with the incredibly shitty reality that white people may at any moment turn on him like rabid dogs, but the harassment kept coming.While police dragged their feet in arresting his attackers, waiting only until social media had identified the majority and had given them no choice in the matter, Harris and his family continued to receive death threats from Donald Trump s  very fine people. At the same time, the Nazis worked round the clock to  painstakingly compile the video evidence  that ultimately led to Harris  arrest   yes, Harris was arrested. WCPO reports: Deandre Harris, a black man whose brutal beating at the hands of Charlottesville white supremacists was captured on video, is now wanted on charges of unlawful wounding in connection to the Aug. 12 incident.A magistrate, not the police department, issued the warrant, although a news release said police officers had verified other video that led to the arrest. Harris is accused of attacking a man in the group that beat him.Harris  attorney, Lee Merritt, who called the charge a  clearly retaliatory  effort from white supremacists after Harris used social media to identify suspects in the beating, said his client would turn himself in within 24 hours.Journalist Chuck Modi posted video of the attack, which took place in a parking garage near the University of Virginia campus, on Twitter. In the clip, white supremacist marchers   some in white polos, some in riot gear   beat Harris with signs and poles while he struggles to stand.In case you somehow forgot what happened, here is a refresher.This video is horrifying:Fight broke out. Nazis beat black kid w/sticks at end. I kick one in back 2 help & he runs after me. Kid is safe but bloody #Charlottesville pic.twitter.com/kr11a8zQ0K  ChuckModi (@ChuckModi1) August 12, 2017Naturally, the Nazis are celebrating this new turn of events that they apparently helped orchestrate:I would like to thank everyone who helped us with the DeAndre Harris case particularly those who painstakingly compiled the video evidence  Hunter Wallace (@occdissent) October 9, 2017You see, since they have gotten Harris charged with a crime, they can move on to their endgame   which is apparently getting Harris  GoFundMe shut down:We need to stop his go fund me ? I've reported it long ago https://t.co/PBLKI91GaI  Joni Job (@jj_talking) October 9, 2017I reported the campaign too  ?Chris? (@FireyChris) October 9, 2017Wallace also shared his thoughts on Heather Heyer, the woman who was run down by a Nazi at the same rally:Did you know Heather Heyer was morbidly obese and died of a heart attack? Probably not because that story didn't fit the narrative either https://t.co/3v3wk1QMoq  Hunter Wallace (@occdissent) October 10, 2017The  evidence  the Nazis collected is 5 seconds of video that appears to show Harris hit a Nazi who was trying to jab another protester with a pole. While one would normally assume that acting in defense of another would be something law enforcement would understand, this is the same law enforcement that allowed a Nazi to try to shoot someone and walk away while they watched.Of course they were going to charge Harris with whatever they could. To do otherwise would conflict with the traditionally terrible response Charlottesville has had to Nazis marching in the f*cking street, attacking people, and even committing murder.Daniel Borden, one of the numerous attackers, has also been arrested in connection with the brutal gang assault. No one else has been charged aside from Harris   the victim.Featured image via screengrab",News
 Corker Has Last Word On Day Care Donnie: â€˜On The Path To WWIIIâ€™,"Tennessee Republican Senator Bob Corker announced last month that he wouldn t be seeking reelection when his term expires at the end of next year, but now President Donald Trump and Corker have had a public falling out on Trump s beloved platform, Twitter.It all kicked off on Sunday morning when Trump posted a series of tweets claiming that he denied Corker s request for an endorsement. Todd Womack, Corker s chief of staff, refuted the claim later in the day, saying in a statement that the President called Senator Corker on Monday afternoon and asked him to reconsider his decision not to seek reelection and reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him, as he has said many times. Trump s Corker-directed fit of tweet-rage came just days after the Senator publicly criticized the President, a move that never sits well with Trump, leading him to try and seek revenge:Senator Bob Corker ""begged"" me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said ""NO"" and he dropped out (said he could not win without  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2017..my endorsement). He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said ""NO THANKS."" He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2017 Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn't have the guts to run!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2017Senator Bob Corker is clearly the thicker-skinned of the two. However, he wasn t going to let an opportunity like this go to waste and decided to respond to the President s barbs, calling the current administration out for being exactly how many see it:It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.  Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) October 8, 2017Corker later decided enough was enough and opted to tell it like it is in a phone interview with The New York Times on Sunday night, claiming that Trump was treating the presidency like  a reality show,  making reckless threats against other countries that put the United States  on the path to World War III. He concerns me,  Mr. Corker said.  He would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation,  he said. He was far from done.  I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it s a situation of trying to contain him,  the Senator said in the interview.When it came to the tweets, Corker simply confirmed what we already knew. I don t know why the president tweets out things that are not true,  he said.  You know he does it, everyone knows he does it, but he does. The Senator s criticism had clearly stuck in the President s craw a little. Trump is a man who always needs to have the last word and, being unable to shake Corker s snide tweet or his brutal honesty with The New York Times, made the following tweet Sunday evening:Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that's about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2017Featured image via Sara D. Davis/Getty Images",News
" Pence Joins Trumpâ€™s NFL Whinefest, Leaves Colts Game In A Huff Over Police Brutality Protests","People like to pretend that Mike Pence is the grown-up in the room compared to Donald Trump s brash childishness from the White House. However, he proved that wrong on Sunday, when he left the Indiana Colts football game because a few of the players on the team opposing the Colts chose to take a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality against black and brown Americans. Taking a leaf out of Trump s playbook, Pence tweeted:I left today's Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.  Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don't think it's too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem  Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017Just like Trump, Pence forgets the meaning of the First Amendment, and seems to think that his position gives him the right to try to bully owners, players, and ultimately the National Football League into following his orders. Further, it is worth noting that the Colts were playing the San Francisco 49ers, which is the former team of Colin Kaepernick, the man who started this protest before being blacklisted from the NFL for taking a stand against police brutality against people of color. Further, Pence and Trump admitted that they used the situation to divide the country and make some kind of point on the taxpayers  dime   because of course we paid for Pence to travel to that football game. For one thing, the press was kept in the van, in anticipation of Pence stirring the pot and then leaving:The media pool was kept in the vans ahead of the game instead of being led in with VPOTUS. https://t.co/NXIFZCp3fb  Vaughn Hillyard (@VaughnHillyard) October 8, 2017FLAG: Was Pence leaving Colts game a political stunt? Reporters were told to stay in van bc ""there may be an early departure from the game.""  Peter Alexander (@PeterAlexander) October 8, 2017Then, Trump  admitted to ordering Pence to leave if the 49ers took a knee, which of course everyone knew they would:I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2017So, in short, this was all premeditated racial pot stirring. Unsurprising from Trump, but somewhat surprising from Pence, who has been trying very hard to keep up the idea of how OMFG #notracist! he is.

" If This Missouri Senate Candidate Is For Real, Heâ€™s A Real Subhuman Scumbag","Add this name to the list of people you ve never heard of, but are about to: Courtland Sykes.The Missouri Republican is a Navy Veteran, an impossibly good looking model-type, and a misogynist pig who s stuck in the early 1950 s. He s also running for the United States Senate in an uphill challenge against Democrat Claire McCaskill.The problem is, since he announced his run at the Senate, nobody s sat him down for an interview. He has, however, released a headshot to reporters, along with an interview-style, 11-page document that outlines some of his positions:He also addressed whether he favored women s rights, in a way that beggars belief: Chanel (Rion), my fiancee, has given me orders to favor these rights, so I d better. But Chanel knows that my obedience comes with a small price that she loves to pay anyway   I want to come home to a home-cooked dinner at six every night, one that she fixes.It s exactly the kind of family dinner that I expect one day my future daughters will learn to make after they too become traditional homemakers and family wives   think Norman Rockwell here   and Gloria Steinham be damned. Now, I m not sure if Sykes is aware of Rockwell s liberalism after he began seeing a psychotherapist for his severe depression (likely brought on by the fact that his art was hijacked by Cold War politics), but he should probably check out some of Norman s later work before he starts citing him as an influence,   la Saturday Evening Post.That headshot, though:Oh, I ve already Google reverse image-searched it.

 WATCH: Fox Anchor Chris Wallace Rips NRA Stooge A New One For Lying About Gun Control,"Chris Wallace tore this prick apart.It s only been a week since a gunman shot and killed 58 people and wounded nearly 500 in Las Vegas with a fully automatic assault weapon.On Sunday, National Rifle Association executive director Chris Cox appeared on Fox News Sunday and began by appearing to suggest that the NRA is only calling for regulating bump stocks because NRA members were shot at the concert. You know, because non-NRA members apparently don t matter.Anyway, Cox went on to once again say that we should not be discussing gun control after this latest mass shooting and that we should wait in the name of  common decency. Host Chris Wallace had a problem with that. You say common decency, let s wait, what s enough time?  Wallace asked.  I mean, here were 58 people killed, almost 500 injured. Is it common decency to wait a day, two days, a week, a month. I mean, it is understandable   I know you don t agree with their solution but what s wrong with saying we need to address this? Of course, rather than answer the question, Cox turned the discussion into an attack on Hillary Clinton and other Democrats, all while whining about them have armed guards. Is that a sensible way to have this conversation, to try to turn it into class warfare, where if you re for gun control somehow you re part of an elite?  Wallace responded.Indeed, after the numerous death threats directed at her during the 2016 campaign, including one by Trump in which he called for  Second Amendment people  to do something if she had won, it s understandable why Hillary Clinton would want security. It s not class warfare,  Cox replied.  It s what the American people want. And that s when Wallace buried him. That s not actually true. If you talk about background checks, if you talk about automatic weapons   there are a lot of people, in fact a majority of people according to the polls who would like to see those gun controls. I have to say that I m put off at the argument, if you believe in gun control, you re an elite. I have to tell you, Mr. Cox, I know very few people  who have armed body guards. One of the few people I know who has armed body guards is Wayne LaPierre. We can argue about the merits of it. But I think to dismiss people and say,  Well, that s just the elite and they have armed guards,  it seems to me does a disservice to your argument. Here s the video via YouTube.A CBS poll last year found that 57 percent of Americans support an assault weapons ban.And polls consistently show that 80 percent to 90 percent of Americans, including 74 percent of NRA members, want background checks for all gun sales.So, Cox was clearly lying and Wallace rightfully called him out for it.Featured Image: Screenshot",News
 Outgoing GOP Senator BLISTERS The â€˜Adult Daycare Centerâ€™ That Is Trumpâ€™s White House (TWEET),"Senator Bob Corker (R-TN) has had enough of the chaos in Donald Trump s White House. He is so fed up, in fact, that he is choosing to retire rather than run for another term. Therefore, there is no political cost to pay for criticizing Trump, and boy is he taking advantage. First, Senator Corker called Trump unstable after the disastrous response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville. Then, he said that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Secretary of Defense General James Mattis, and White House Chief of Staff General John Kelly are the only people standing between the United States of America and complete chaos. Now, Corker is going all in on Trump s childish Twitter habits. On Sunday morning, in response to more Twitter vomit from Trump, Corker tweeted:It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.  Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) October 8, 2017BOOM! Corker is clearly completely unleashed here and out of f*cks to give when it comes to Trump s unseemly and disgraceful behavior from the highest office in the land. This is important though, for another reason: The fact that likely his comrades in the Republican Party on Capitol Hill are feeling the same way, and simply can t say it for fear of alienating Trump s base and losing their Congressional majority. However, since Corker is leaving, he clearly doesn t care about any of that. This opens a door, though   the one that allows GOP lawmakers to say what they REALLY think of Trump. If the guy who was second in line to become Secretary of State is saying this about Trump, what is everyone else saying behind closed doors? Now that Corker has opened the door for them to go public, all they need to do is walk through it.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News

A lot of Nazis were identified following the violent protest in which Heather Heyer was murdered and left 19 others injured after another one of Trump s  very fine people  used his car as a weapon to mow down anti-racist protesters.Trump has repeatedly blamed  both sides  for the attack. Democrats and Republicans both condemned Trump s remarks.Last night, there was another torch rally in Charlottesville featuring human punching bag Richard Spencer. Videos and pictures are being circulated on social media. Although only about 30 Nazis showed up to intimidate the city again, they might suffer consequences for their actions, if identified. It s 2017, and we re witnessing Nazis storming down our streets and obviously, these Trump supporters aren t nice-time Nazis who use Hello Kitty computers.Like, for example, James Alex Fields, the 20-year-old Ohio man who was arrested on the day of the rally and charged with second-degree murder, among other counts, after driving a car into the crowd of anti-racists, killing Ms. Heyer. But Trump won t call it  terrorism  because they are his  very fine people. Mothersbaugh needs a new t-shirt which reads,  God, Guns, Trump, Prison. Image via Twitter. ",News
 Nazis Whine Over Impending Release Of An Anti-Nazi Video Game (VIDEO/TWEETS),"With the rise of Donald Trump has also come the rise of literal Nazism in America. When the streets of an American street look more like 1930s Germany as they did in Charlottesville, Virginia just weeks ago with murder as the end result, it is time for people to use whatever platforms they have to speak out against Nazism. That is just what is being done by the makers of the video game Wolfenstein II. The company will be releasing a new game on October 27, and it is all about killing Nazis. In a tweet, including a short video, the company made it clear: No Nazis in America. Here is that tweet:Make America Nazi-Free Again. #NoMoreNazis #Wolf2 pic.twitter.com/52OESypw4P  Wolfenstein (@wolfenstein) October 5, 2017Of course, being the idiots that they are, the actual Nazis on Twitter just could not contain themselves, and they lashed out in a rage against the makers of Wolfenstein.

Apparently, it is now debatable in America as to whether a video game going after Nazis should be played, because we have literal Nazis right in the middle of our mainstream political culture. This is what happens when you elect a literal fascist as president folks. Thank all of the people who were stupid enough to fall for this con man when we descend further into something so unimaginably dire at the hands of Donald Trump and his white supremacist government and mouthbreathing followers.One would like to believe that good will triumph in the end, but who really knows at this point?Featured image via screen capture from Twitter",News
 A New Low: Trump Exploits Las Vegas Shooting To Raise Money For His Campaign (TWEET),"Donald Trump doesn t exactly hide the fact that he s a sociopath. Just looking at the most recent events this country has faced, we ve witnessed the President of the United States turn his back on human suffering and be completely indifferent to those in need. As we saw with the hurricane that ravaged Puerto Rico and the Las Vegas massacre, Trump is constantly missing in action and spending more time on Twitter than actually doing his job. That s why the latest move by Trump and his campaign shouldn t surprise anyone, even though it s downright heartless.On Saturday, Trump s campaign sent out a fundraising email that was so disgusting, it immediately drew attention on Twitter. In the email, Trump exploited the mass shooting in Las Vegas to raise funds for his pathetic re-election campaign. In the Trump-Pence Weekly Newsletter, the Trump campaign spoke to potential donors and supporters of Trump, mentioning Trump s recent visit to Las Vegas. The emails said: Our nation is still in shock and mourning following the massacre of 58 concertgoers and hundreds of others injured in Las Vegas. Then, the email states that Trump and First Lady Melania had spoken to victims and given credit to first responders. We know that your sorrow feels endless. We stand together to help you carry your pain. You can catch a glimpse of the horrific email below:Unreal: the Trump campaign just sent an email using the Las Vegas shooting to fundraise for the campaign. pic.twitter.com/MWYu0Sa3VF  Matt McDermott (@mattmfm) October 7, 2017Trump has been doing fundraiser after fundraiser in preparation for his re-election campaign, which is somewhat hilarious considering that his approval rating just hit a new historic low.

 â€˜Charlottesville 3.0â€™: Nazis Descend Upon College Town For Another Torch-Lit Rally (TWEETS/IMAGES),"We all remember the horrific violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia in August. White supremacists, Ku Klux Klan members, and other assorted white supremacists descended upon the historic college town to do violence, and they succeeded. Their efforts began with a torch lit march the night before, and continued with a rally the next day that quickly turned violent. It eventually ended in a white supremacist driving his car into a crowd of counter-protesters and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. Now, it seems that they are at it again.As of this writing, white nationalists are holding another torch lit march in Charlottesville. As despicable as that is, it s true. White supremacist leader Richard Spencer boasted that what he calls  Charlottesville 3.0  was, quote, a  success. Charlottesville 3.0 was as success. pic.twitter.com/c18ktP0MWD  Richard  ?Spencer (@RichardBSpencer) October 8, 2017Here is a photo of the horror unfolding there, courtesy of the anti-fascist website It s Going Down s Twitter:Neo-Nazis have rallied with torches again in #Charlottesville.

That is what they want. Hopefully, no one gets killed this time.This story is breaking. Stay tuned to Addicting Info for further updates.Featured image via screen capture from Twitter",News
 Conservative Dream Come True: Judge Grants Rapist Joint Custody Of Victimâ€™s Child,"If Republicans have their way, rape victims will continue to be terrorized by their rapists.The victim was only 12 years old when Christopher Mirasolo raped her and impregnated her. Despite also threatening her life, Mirasolo only spent six months in prison, only to spend four more years in prison for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl.That being said, Mirasolo should NOT be allowed anywhere near a child and should still be rotting in prison.But a Michigan judge has decided that Mirasolo should have joint custody of the child his victim gave birth to eight years ago.According to The Detroit News, county officials surveyed the victim s use of food stamps, aid she relies on to take care of her eight-year-old son.For some reason, the county connected her to Mirasolo and a DNA test was taken. It appears the county was searching for a reason to kick her and her son off the food stamp program so they did all of this without her consent.Well, despite the fact that Mirasolo is the victim s rapist, Sanilac County Circuit Judge Gregory S. Ross gave him joint custody of child, ordered the victim to move back to Michigan, and gave her address to Mirasolo.In other words, Judge Ross just put a woman s life in danger and endangered a child.And by giving Mirasolo joint custody, he is allowing a rapist to continue terrorizing his victim. I think this is all crazy,  the victim told The Detroit News.  They never explained anything to me. I was receiving about $260 a month in food stamps for me and my son and health insurance for him. I guess they were trying to see how to get some of the money back. Her attorney is also rightfully pissed off.This is insane,  attorney Rebecca Kiessling said.  Nothing has been right about this since it was originally investigated. He was never properly charged and should still be sitting behind bars somewhere, but the system is victimizing my client, who was a child herself when this all happened. And the same scenario could play out across the nation if Republicans have their way. House Republicans recently passed a bill banning abortion after 20 weeks and you can be damn sure they will keep trying to ban abortion entirely, with zero exceptions for rape victims. That means rapists will be able to seek joint custody in order to make their victim s lives a living hell. Imagine having to interact with the person who raped you and having to hand your child over to them.It s a terrifying scenario that no rape victim should have to face. Conservatives are constantly telling us that rape victims should carry these pregnancies to term because the baby isn t to blame. But as long as rapists are able to pursue custody and terrorize their victims for the rest of their lives, women should never lose the right to choose. Because no one should be forced to live their life in terror and fear.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News
" Trump Whines About Late Night Hosts Making Jokes About Him, Accuses Them Of Conspiring With Democrats","Donald Trump put on his tin-foil hat and raged at Late Night television hosts on Saturday morning.Late Night television shows have seen a resurgence this year, especially The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, which has gotten more popular since Trump took office.Of course, after all the bullshit Trump has said and done over the last nine months, comedians have enough material to keep them busy for years to come.But Trump is now whining about being the main joke on Late Night, and he even threw a temper tantrum accusing them of conspiring with the Democrats.Late Night host are dealing with the Democrats for their very  unfunny  & repetitive material, always anti-Trump! Should we get Equal Time?  Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2017Seriously, Trump literally complained that Democrats aren t being mocked equally.The problem is that Trump has been nothing but a giant punchline.He has embarrassed himself and America and everything he says and does is a joke. America has become an international laughingstock.There s also this thing called the First Amendment. You know, that constitutional right giving comedians the ability to joke about anything they damn well please.In other words, Trump cannot force comedians to stop making fun of him.You never heard President Obama whine about being joked about on Late Night comedy shows. But President Obama is an adult who is able to take a joke, while Trump is thin-skinned and petty.As for  equal time,  Republicans usually dominate the Sunday news cycle and Fox News is clearly not  fair and balanced.  You never hear Trump complain about Fox & Friends kissing his ass all the time.Furthermore, shouldn t Trump be focused on running the country instead of staying up late to watch television?Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News
" Trump Bucks GOP Leadership Again, Runs Back Into The Arms Of Chuck And Nancy","Donald Trump blindsided GOP leadership a couple of weeks ago when he struck a deal with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi with regards the Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals (DACA). Now, Trump seems to, again, be running to his new friends  Chuck and Nancy  as he calls them   this time on healthcare.In an early morning tweet on Saturday, Trump said that he had spoken with Senator Schumer regarding some kind of healthcare deal.I called Chuck Schumer yesterday to see if the Dems want to do a great HealthCare Bill. ObamaCare is badly broken, big premiums. Who knows!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2017Now, for the longest time, Trump has been in an uneasy relationship with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI). They tolerated him during the campaign because their mouthbreathing voters decided that an unqualified orange fascist would be a better nominee and president than any of the actually qualified people in the GOP primary, and certainly better than any Democrat. Therefore, the GOP leadership had no choice but to watch helplessly as the party of Reagan became the party of Trump. Now, it seems that they have lost control of the Frankenstein monster they got elected president, and it seems that their efforts were all for naught.Trump will be in the Oval Office schmoozing with Chuck and Nancy while McConnell and Ryan are stuck out in the cold, looking helplessly as this man once again makes fools of them.Well, when you make a deal with the devil, you get burned, and Chuck and Nancy are smart enough to con the con man, and it just might save healthcare for millions of Americans.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News

 WATCH: Mike Penceâ€™s Photo Op With Puerto Rico Survivors Just Went TERRIBLY Wrong (VIDEO),"Proving that Donald Trump and his administration is the most clueless, out of touch team to  lead  America, Vice President Mike Pence just had a really awkward run-in with one of the survivors of Hurricane Maria.As Puerto Rico is absolutely ravaged from the recent hurricane, Trump has decided to turn his back on U.S. citizens and instead focus on attacking NFL players and the media. Meanwhile, his team is trying to do damage control to pick up the slack, and sent Pence to Puerto Rico to assure survivors that everything would be okay. Unfortunately, that plan backfired tremendously.Everlinda Burgos, a survivor of Hurricane Maria from central Puerto Rico, ruined Pence s photo op by holding the Trump administration accountable and pointing out that they weren t doing nearly enough. As cameras rolled, Burgos put Pence on the spot and said: Don t go to San Juan. Go inside the country, like where I live. I live in Naranjito, that s inside the country. Right now, inside the country is where you re going to see the disaster. Where you can t   there s towns you can t go in. Burgos also nailed Pence s boss by bringing up Trump s disgusting, insensitive comment that Puerto Rico officials should be  very proud  that only sixteen people had died. Burgos said: You don t know the people that has died there because they don t know, they don t have no communication. You know? So, right now they say 18 people died. No, no, no. We have more people died. But we don t have no communication. So, go in. And things got even worse for Pence. Off-camera, a woman jumped in to correct Burgos and said the most current death toll stated thirty-four. Burgos added: Thirty-four today. Right now, that s what they say outside. Pence didn t know what the hell to say, so he muttered  Good to talk.  But Burgos wasn t done with him. She said: I would like you to go to the center. Because that s where the disaster is. Pence made a half-ass agreement and then asked,  You ll be fine, your son, your family, and then you ll be able to go home, right?  Clearly, he was still clueless of how bad the situation was, and likely had no intention of going through with his promise.You can watch his awkward exchange with Burgos below:The people of Puerto Rico deserve better.Featured image via Mark Wilson / Getty Images",News
" SURPRISE: The People Behind â€˜Fearless Girlâ€™ Statue Were Cynical, Greedy, Anti-Feminist Men","There were a lot of arguments online after the  Fearless Girl  statue was erected in front of the Wall Street Bull. Many people thought it was a perfect representation of standing up to the male-dominated culture of the financial industry, while others felt like it was just another commercial effort to cash in on the popularity of public companies suddenly growing a conscience and adopting policies that appease  social justice warriors  (also known as decent human beings).Unfortunately, one of those arguments has been proven right.According to the New York Post, the firm behind the statue that went up ostensibly to  promote gender equality,  State Street Corp, was caught underpaying 300 female employees, along with 15 more who were black.After the company was audited by the Department of Labor s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, they promised they would come up with the money, but in the meantime, it just looks bad. The company settled for $5 million, an astounding amount, considering the relatively small number of affected employees.How far will this faux-minism set women back? None.

Noted misogynist and all-around piece of shit James Woods chimed in, of course, although to pick up his subtle dig at feminism requires reading the replies to his tweet   which he was fishing for. A full complement of alt-right Trump trolls joined the party, and anti-feminists everywhere saw the hypocrisy and cynicism of this one company as emblematic of the whole:The Fearless Girl statue is utterly moronic, but it exemplifies the feminist movement.

 Trump Kicks Off Hispanic Heritage Month By Saying â€˜Puerto Ricoâ€™ In Fake Accent (VIDEO),"Donald Trump kicked off Hispanic Heritage Month on Friday during an event at the White House. He did this after his thoroughly embarrassing tour of hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico in which he lobbed rolls of paper towels at victims of the hurricane and that was after he blamed the island for the natural disaster. Puerto Ricans are very proud people, but Trump tried to diminish them.Trump spoke on different topics during his speech, from the economy to the Las Vegas massacre, then he addressed Puerto Rico which is now in crisis after Hurricanes Maria and Irma devasted the U.S. territory. We are also praying for the people of Puerto Rico,  Trump said while using an exaggerated Spanish accent. We love Puerrrrtoooo Ricooo,  he continued, again with the accent.  Puerto Rico,  he said again.At that point, a woman yelled out,   We love you!  and Trump then said  and we also love Puerto Rico,  but this time, the fake president dropped his fake accent.Watch:Trump says Puerto Rico in an affected Spanish accent three times in a row.

Perhaps a better way of honoring Puerto Ricans would be to not try to cover up his own misdeeds in handling the humanitarian crisis. On Oct. 4th, half of the residents in Puerto Rico had access to clean water and 5 percent of the island had electricity, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency website. However, by Oct. 5th, FEMA had removed statistics on Puerto Rico s water and power supply from its website, so now we have no idea of what the island is dealing with and what they need to survive. The only thing FEMA left on its site was good news; not the real news which is very bleak.Information on water access and electricity on the island is available only on a website maintained by the office of Gov. Rossell , StatusPR. According to the website, 9.2 percent of the island has power and 54.2 percent of people have some form of drinking water.But Trump says he  loves  Puerto Ricans as he mocks their accent.Image via screen capture.

 Thanks To Trump The U.S. Economy Lost Jobs For The First Time In 7 Years,"After taking office, Donald Trump has repeatedly taken credit for President Obama s economy and regularly touts jobs numbers on his Twitter timeline. Now that Trump s economy is in effect, we doubt he ll be tweeting about the labor market losing 33,000 jobs last month.While some of this can be attributed to natural disasters, Trump has also failed to pass any major legislation.Job growth in August and July was revised down, to 38,000 less than previously reported. Economists expected 75,000 new jobs instead of a 33,000 job loss.The economy has added an average of 172,000 jobs a month over the past year but that has dropped to a 91,000 average over the past three months, showing a trend which is not in Trump s favor.Axios reports:Economists widely blame the disruptive effects of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey for the disappointing number, because the survey methodology dictates that folks who didn t get paid on the pay period that included September 12th are not counted as employed.But the report also revised down the two previous monthly estimates of job growth, suggested the slowdown is not all weather related.After Obama took office, he had quite a task on his hands in dealing with the cost of his predecessor s wars, but he did it. Obama s economy took an upward swing, even after natural disasters such as Hurricane Sandy and the floods which ravaged Louisiana. Throughout his campaign, Trump called Obama s economy  a disaster  but compared to other presidents, that was far from the truth.Fact: Obama took office during the worst recession since the Great Depression when the economy was losing 750,000 jobs a month and already had lost a record 9 percent of GDP. Obama started with a weak economy due to his predecessor s decisions but his final jobs report showed 75 consecutive months of growth.The unemployment rate, however, just fell to 4.2 percent, and we re sure Trump will bring that up. Let s see how long that lasts because the former reality show star is now making war noises toward North Korea. Also, if Trump manages to get the GOP tax proposal in the works, we ll see more reports like this one.But for a guy whose  presidency  has been based on undoing everything Obama has done, he sure did a good job of that with the first loss of jobs reported in 7 years.Photo: Alex Wong via Getty Images.

" SLC Cops Murder Crying Suspect, Shoot Him In The Back AND Taser Him Without Even Pursuing","On Sunday, August 13th, Salt Lake City Police seemed to have a routine bicycle stop under control. Patrick Harmon, a 50-year-old black man who was pulled over on his bike for riding without a working taillight at night, was standing on the side of the road with officers complying with their requests. Officer Clinton Fox asked Harmon if he knew about his warrants, which Harmon answered in the affirmative. Harmon was in tears throughout the encounter.Then, as Harmon finished removing his backpack as Officer Fox requested, he decided he was too scared of jail to stay. He got loose of the straps of his pack and ran.Did Clinton Fox, fellow human being, decide to run after Patrick Harmon? Not on your life. Or more precisely, not on Patrick s. One assumes that Fox, being a police officer, was in far superior shape to the middle-aged man smoking a cigarette only moments before, but rather than expend the energy it would ve required to run his suspect down on foot   like police do every damn day   he instead chose to draw his service weapon and fire three shots into Harmon s back as he ran. His finger was already pulling the trigger the first time by the moment he shouted  I m gonna fuckin  shoot you! Harmon s sobbing can be heard as he lies prone on the sidewalk. The light of another officer s taser, which had been at the ready well before Officer Fox shot Harmon in the back, circles around Patrick s heaving body. I got  im,  says Officer Fox.The DA would later say that the shooting was  legally justified,  before the body camera footage you re about to see was released. The police report would alternately first say that Harmon was on foot, then on a bike. It would say that he had a gun, then it was changed to a knife. His rap sheet was public long before the footage.Patrick s sister Antoinette drove 1,300 miles to join the rally held by Black Lives Matter organizer Lex Scott to demand the release of the body cam video. Ms. Scott has held many such rallies. This is about accountability and transparency. This is about Patrick Harmon s family deserving to see that footage. If [SLCPD] did nothing wrong, wouldn t they have released the footage by now? Now the footage has been released, and it is damning.Will Officer Fox face consequences for the apparent murder of Patrick Harmon? The shooting, by any metric, is certainly not justified. Will the DA withdraw their statements? Will the SLCPD form a tight ring around their comrade, squeezing out truth and transparency?Let s hope this incident breaks the pattern and there is accountability.THE FOLLOWING FOOTAGE IS GRAPHIC AND SHOWS THE SHOOTING OF PATRICK HARMONFeatured image via George Frey/Getty Images",News
 Anti-Abortion Republican Just Aborted Himself From Office,"U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy, a staunch  pro-life  Republican representing Pennsylvania s 18th District, has resigned after being caught in a scandal which involves adultery and encouraging his mistress to get an abortion. After Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.) was caught being a hypocrite of the highest order, he announced his resignation on Thursday after announcing his plan to retire after 2018. This afternoon I received a letter of resignation from Congressman Tim Murphy, effective October 21,  Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement.  It was Dr. Murphy s decision to move on to the next chapter of his life, and I support it. Well, it wasn t exactly Murphy s decision really.House GOP leaders and senior Republicans pressured Murphy to step down, according to Politico.GOP sources familiar with Murphy s thinking said the married man initially believed he could weather the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette story revealing he had encouraged an abortion in texts he sent to his girlfriend, a psychologist half his age.However, in contrast to what Murphy thought, many senior Republicans did not believe he could weather the scandal  or should   until the end of his term.Several top Republicans said that Paul Ryan, who met with Murphy on Wednesday evening to discuss his future, also wanted him to step down.So really, anti-abortion Republicans aborted him from office because he was caught. GOP insiders also worried that more damaging stories could surface. And stories, in fact, were surfacing with allegations of being abusive toward his staff for years by yelling at aides and throwing folders around. Murphy reportedly berated his staff members as  worthless  and  stupid.  Murphy s chief of staff Susan Mosychuk reportedly punished staffers by making them take the stairs instead of the elevator if she thought they underperformed.Republicans didn t request his resignation because he was such a hypocritical jerkwad:Republicans believed the matter could become an ethics issue that would trigger an investigation and distract from GOP messaging. With Murphy set to resign later this month, any ethics probes would die before even getting started.One of the texts the Gazette obtained was by Shannon Edwards, a married forensic psychologist half his age with whom he was having an affair. And you have zero issue posting your pro-life stance all over the place when you had no issue asking me to abort our unborn child just last week when we thought that was one of the options,  wrote Edwards. Mrs. Edwards is now going through a divorce following the affair.Photo via Wikipedia. ",News
 The Justice Department Just Said Itâ€™s Legal To Discriminate Against Transgender People,"In the Trump administration s ongoing war on the LGBTQ+ community, the president has no greater champion than one Jefferson Beauregard Sessions, the head of the Justice Department.

Virginia to maintain a ban on interracial marriage, that discrimination against gays and lesbians was constitutionally protected because it applied equally to men and women.Now Sessions has narrowed his focus to the  T  part of his least favorite acronym: Transgender people. Early Thursday, the DOJ issued a memo stating their official position that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not protect transgender workers from discrimination for the same reason: Because employers wouldn t be discriminating based on gender, since transgender people of any biological gender could be equally discriminated against.Through spokesman Devin O Malley, Trump s Justice Department issued a statement on the reason for the reversal of an Obama-era memo which stated Title VII does apply, saying that the government can t expand the meaning of a law beyond what Congress intended when it was passed: Unfortunately, the last administration abandoned that fundamental principle, which necessitated today s action. You catch that? Necessitated. As in, we had to correct this, lest some weirdo think we might protect them when we don t want to. Sessions and the DOJ felt it was necessary to clarify that transgender workers don t have the same civil rights as everyone else, because you know, they ve got nothing better to do. They re certainly not focusing on the growing Nazi movement in America.I wish I could say that I was confident the courts would strike this asinine decision down, but I m just not. It s hard to have faith in a Justice system that continues to protect white supremacists, gun fanatics, religious extremists, and anti-choice activists  All as they throw the most vulnerable among us to the wolves.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images",News
" The Senate Banking Committee Held An Equifax Hearing, And The Monopoly Man Showed Up","Remember when half of America had their credit information compromised during the Equifax data breach? Over 143 million people were affected by the largest banking hack ever recorded. People s Social Security numbers, names, addresses, birth dates, and even driver s license numbers in some cases were accessed by the hackers. They even got more than two hundred thousand actual credit card numbers.The CEO is now the former CEO, although it remains to be seen whether he ll get a giant  golden parachute  severance package. Especially after testifying Wednesday that the whole mess was pretty much one guy s fault   which is either laughably ridiculous or absolutely terrifying   and effectively passing the buck on responsibility for the worst security failure the banking industry has ever seen.But when disgraced former Equifax chief Richard Smith appeared in front of the Senate Banking Committee to finally answer questions regarding why the company didn t address the vulnerability months ago when they were first made aware of it, there was a spectator in the room who was clearly concerned about the findings of the committee as well: Rich Uncle Pennybags, better known as the Monopoly Man.He s ruined family relationships since 1936. He s sold false hope inside tiny stamps to McDonald s customers since 1987. And now Uncle Pennybags is trolling Richard Smith and the Senate Banking Committee.How anyone kept a straight face when they saw this in the room is totally beyond me:A tip of the hat to the Monopoly Man!You good sir took a chance and it paid off during the Equifax hearings.Now go collect $200 pic.twitter.com/kR8m2qID8U  Red T Raccoon (@RedTRaccoon) October 4, 2017Imagine Elizabeth Warren looking that character in the eye and not just cracking up.The best part?

" In The Wake Of Las Vegas, The GOP Are Finally Beginning To Support Gun Control","A quick look at the statistics shows that six of the 10 deadliest mass shootings on record in the US have occurred in the last decade, the top two less than 18 months apart, yet Republicans have generally been opposed to almost any form of gun control. However, that appears to be changing in the aftermath of yet another tragedy.Democrats, spearheaded by California Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, have proposed a ban on an accessory known as a  bump stock,  which uses the recoil of a semi-automatic firearm to fire several hundred shots per minute without compromising on accuracy, something that really isn t necessary for even the most avid outdoorsman, and a device that few lawmakers had even heard of before Monday.The most surprising part of this proposal is that it is gaining support from Republicans across the board and it s the first time Republicans have even considered discussing any form of gun control since 2012, when 20-year-old Adam Lanza shot and killed 20 children aged between six and seven years old, as well as six adult staff members, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut.Republican support for the proposal, however, is a small victory along the long and bumpy road to becoming legislation. Not only will the measure need to be approved by Republicans on Capitol Hill, it will also need the backing of President Trump, whose campaign last year was heavily endorsed by the infinitely powerful National Rifle Association (NRA).All the same, it is an excellent start when a Congressman from Texas is the first Republican to support the ban on bump stocks. That Congressman is Bill Flores. I think they should be banned. There s no reason for a typical gun owner to own anything that converts a semi-automatic to something that behaves like an automatic,  Flores, a gun owner, said in an interview just off the House floor. Based on the videos I heard and saw, and now that I ve studied up on what a bump stock is   I didn t know there was such a thing   there s no reason for it,  he added. I have no problem from banning myself from owning it. Other House Republican moderates that agree with Flores include Charlie Dent and Ryan Costello from Pennsylvania, Leonard Lance of New Jersey and Pete King from New York. I m ready to say that they should not be in public use. I think they are a problem. I support a ban on bump stocks. I don t see any purpose for them,  Dent said. The law is clear to me that automatic weapons are banned in this country, as they should be. Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News
 Hilarious Video Shows The Moment Bernie Discovered Heâ€™s Related To His SNL Impersonator,"The 2016 election cycle was rife with hilarious   and often spot on   impersonations of the most talked about candidates. One such candidate was, of course, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) who was competing for the Democratic Party s presidential nomination. On the iconic sketch show Saturday Night Live, Bernie was prominently portrayed by comedian Larry David. The impression was uncannily accurate   if we didn t know better, Larry David could easily have been mistaken for Bernie Sanders. From looks, to mannerisms, to general speech patterns and demeanor, David s Bernie impression was spot on. Well, there might be a reason for that: It turns out that Bernie Sanders and Larry David are actually related.The best part of all of this is that the two men did not know that they were related until quite recently, and their reactions to the news have been caught on video. They found out via Finding Your Roots, a PBS program that helps people find their ancestry and relatives they perhaps did not know about. It turns out that Sanders and David are cousins.When he found out, David simply said, What the hell. That is really funny. That is amazing Alright, cousin Bernie. Bernie says: You re kidding. That is unbelievable. People say to me, they talk about Larry David, and I say he does a better Bernie Sanders than I do. Well, now we know why Larry David does such a good Bernie impression.At any rate, we could all use a laugh right about now, so enjoy!

 Trump LOSES HIS SH*T On Twitter Because The Media Told The Truth About Him Again,"Donald Trump flew into an uncontrollable rage on Wednesday morning.Upon returning back to the mainland from hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, Trump apparently noticed the accurate coverage of his trip. During that trip, Trump complained about how the disaster is hurting his budget plan and told Puerto Ricans that their catastrophe wasn t a  real catastrophe. And then he threw paper towels to victims as if they were animals.Of course, Trump thinks this is all  fake news  because the media didn t make it look like his trip went well.A great day in Puerto Rico yesterday. While some of the news coverage is Fake, most showed great warmth and friendship.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2017Wow, so many Fake News stories today. No matter what I do or say, they will not write or speak truth. The Fake News Media is out of control!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2017Trump response to the disaster was slow. That s a fact. It s also a fact that the death toll has doubled since he told the people in Puerto Rico that they  should be proud  that only 16 people died.And the media captured Trump s remarks and actions on film for everyone to see.But then Trump attacked NBC for reporting that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson called Trump a  moron  during a Pentagon meeting and threatened to resign.NBC news is #FakeNews and more dishonest than even CNN. They are a disgrace to good reporting. No wonder their news ratings are way down!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2017The @NBCNews story has just been totally refuted by Sec. Tillerson and @VP Pence. It is #FakeNews. They should issue an apology to AMERICA!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 4, 2017Just because the subject of a story denies the report, it doesn t mean the network should retract the story and apologize. News agencies have their sources and they are not going to issue a retraction just because Trump tells them to do so.Furthermore, Trump and his team have lied more than any administration in American history, including the Nixon administration.Their word against that of the three officials who confirmed the story to NBC is meaningless.It should also be pointed out that Tillerson did not outright deny that he called Trump a  moron.

 Anti-Abortion Republican Cheated And Tried To Get His Mistress To Have An Abortion,"A text message which was sent in January to U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy, a staunch  pro-life  Republican representing Pennsylvania s 18th District, is now being revealed. In the text, a woman with whom Murphy was in a relationship outside of his marriage, took him to task for an anti-abortion statement posted on Facebook from his office s public account, the Pittsburg Post-Gazette reports. And you have zero issue posting your pro-life stance all over the place when you had no issue asking me to abort our unborn child just last week when we thought that was one of the options,  wrote Shannon Edwards, a forensic psychologist in Pittsburgh with whom the congressman admitted just last month to having an extramarital relationship. Mrs. Edwards is now going through a divorce following the affair.Murphy publicly admitted to the affair last month. Last year I became involved in an affair with a personal friend. This is nobody s fault but my own, and I offer no excuses. To the extent that there should be any blame in this matter, it falls solely upon me,  he said in a statement at the time.The Gazette notes that a text, which the paper obtained, from Murphy s cell phone number that same day responded to say,  I get what you say about my March for life messages. I ve never written them. Staff does them. I read them and winced,  he continued.  I told staff don t write any more. I will. So, he never believed the anti-choice messages he touted.The Gazette reports:The congressman has been lauded by the Family Research Council, for his stance on abortion, as well as for family values, generally. He also has been endorsed by LifePAC, which opposes abortion rights, and is a member of the House Pro-Life Caucus, an affiliation that is often cited by his office.In addition to Murphy s other problems, a six-page memo to the Pennsylvania Republican, presumably written by his chief of staff, Susan Mosychuk, described a hostile workplace in which Murphy repeatedly denigrated employees, threatened them and created a state of  terror. Apparently, being a  pro-life  Republican means not respecting life while secretly opting to be pro-choice for them. Murphy has voted against funding for Planned Parenthood and voted against federal funding for research that utilizes human embryonic stem cells. He has consistently voted against pro-choice proposals.Image via screen capture.",News
 Trumpâ€™s IRS Just Decided Theyâ€™re Going To Give All Your Info To Equifax After They Got Hacked,"Has anyone else noticed that the government sometimes seems to like awarding contracts to companies that have proven they re incapable of doing what they re supposed to be doing? Equifax s massive data breach affected most Americans with any kind of credit at all, and here comes the IRS to give Equifax a contract in the name of  fraud prevention, because Equifax has proven that they re awesome at protecting our data. Oh! And then they proved that they were totally and completely transparent and on their consumers  sides when they tried to yank away our right to sue by encouraging all of us to enroll in their own fraud protection program with very fine print binding us to arbitration.The contract, which is a $7.25 million contract to verify our identities and prevent fraud, is a  sole source order,  which means the IRS decided Equifax was the only company capable of doing this for them. Supposedly this is to help prevent an interruption in ID verification while officials try and resolve something else.Equifax s security breach involved sensitive information for over 145 million Americans, including our Social Security numbers. Congressman Greg Walden of Oregon likened the breach to the guards at Fort Knox forgetting to lock the doors. That s how bad this hack was.The IRS itself isn t exactly free of security issues, either. They ve had severe problems with tax-ID fraud and other data hacks. Senator Orrin Hatch, of the Senate Finance Committee, has said he s worried the IRS doesn t have the technology necessary  to safeguard the integrity of our tax administration system. Well, it seems Equifax doesn t either, and yet the IRS is giving up our information to them for  fraud prevention. The House Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection subcommittee called Equifax  stupid,  and said they  deserve to be shamed,  and called the breach  shocking  and  unprecedented.  Walden also said: How does this happen when so much is at stake? I don t think we can pass a law that can fix stupid. Apparently they can t regulate the stupid of the IRS, either. We should all cross our fingers and pray nothing else happens to our data now. That s literally about all we can do.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News
" Trump Walks Into Church In Puerto Rico, Starts Throwing Paper Towels At The Crowd (VIDEO)","Before departing for Puerto Rico, Donald Trump hurled an insult at the island, then after landing in the U.S. territory, he continued to embarrass the rest of us. After telling Puerto Ricans whose lives have been devasted by two hurricanes that they are throwing the budget  out of whack,  Trump praised officials on the island with the exception of the Mayor of San Juan, in order to continue his war on Carmen Yul n Cruz.As Trump entered Calvary Chapel, cheers rang out from the crowd, according to The Hill. There were signs in the room which read  Let s Make Puerto Rico Great Again  and  God bless You, Mr. President,  according to a pool report. There are no signs like that visible from the video which captured the former reality show star throwing rolls of paper towels out to the desperate hurricane victims. It s possible, but I just haven t run across any yet online.It s as if Trump thought he was in a Mardi Gras parade, tossing out beads and doubloons to the crowd.While standing behind a table of supplies, Trump said,  There s a lot of love in this room, a lot of love. At that point, Trump handed out a few packages of rice to the crowd, then picked up packaged rolls of paper towels and threw them into the crowd as if he was practicing shooting basketball hoops.A few of the rolls were caught by people in the crowd while another fell to the ground.Watch:.@realDonaldTrump entrega suministros durante su visita a la isla. #TrumpPuertoRico #hurac nMar a pic.twitter.com/aAsND3HRd6  El Nuevo D a (@ElNuevoDia) October 3, 2017It s as if Trump thought he was starring in a game show.Yes, he really did throw paper towels at the church crowd in PR.

" Pat Robertson Says If Weâ€™d Only Worship Trump, Las Vegas Never Wouldâ€™ve Happened","In the wake of any tragedy in this country, there are invariably those who make statements that become indelible. Things get said that we ll remember forever, whether that s a good thing or a bad thing.When George W. Bush said his FEMA Director  Brownie  was doing a  heck of a job,  Dubya couldn t possibly have known it would become synonymous with ironically praising a dismal performance.When reporters are the first to come across emergent tweets about disastrous, high-profile events, they can look just like vultures:Source: TwitterAnd when  spiritual leaders  publicly blame a tragedy on the ills of the world rather than the actual cause, it can leave a similar stain. Remember when Jerry Falwell blamed pagans, gay people, feminists, and  abortionists  for the attacks on September 11, 2001? Of course you do. It was as disgusting then as it is now.Similarly, the man I consider to be the Worst Human On The Planet  just said that the worst mass shooting in American history happened because people talk shit about Donald Trump. Seriously.Pat Robertson, the host of the Christian Broadcasting Network s 700 Club, went on his show Monday and made the predictably horrific statement: Violence in the streets, ladies and gentlemen. Why is it happening? The fact that we have disrespect for authority; there is profound disrespect for our president, all across this nation they say terrible things about him. It s in the news, it s in other places. There is disrespect now for our national anthem, disrespect for our veterans, disrespect for the institutions of our government, disrespect for the court system. All the way up and down the line, disrespect. That s right: People who wish we had a president who didn t act like a schoolyard bully and NFL players who silently protest the murder of unarmed black people across America are to blame for the events of Sunday night in Las Vegas.I have a different belief, Pat. I believe you are responsible for the legions of  Christians  across this country who don t give enough of a fuck about human life to change anything.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images",News
 Trump In Puerto Rico Disgustingly Tells Puerto Ricans Itâ€™s Costing Too Much To Save Them,"Just when you thought he couldn t possibly get worse, Donald Trump lowers the bar. While in Puerto Rico, Donald Trump just told American citizens you re throwing our budget out of whack. Read below:Mick [Mulvaney] is in charge of a thing called budget. Now, I hate to tell you Puerto Rico, but you re throwing our budget a little out of whack, because we ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico.If you look at real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous   hundreds and hundreds of people that died.

Bush s response to Hurricane Katrina. Then he gave himself an A+ grade on the response and proceeded to blame the victims of the hurricane for all the problems.I think it s now no longer acknowledged what a great job we ve done. Texas and Florida we get an A plus. I think we ve done just as good in Puerto Rico and it s a much tougher situation. Now the roads are cleared. Communications starting to come back. We need their truck drivers. Their drivers have to start driving trucks. We have to do that. At a local level they have to give us more help. I will tell you the first responders, the military, FEMA, they have done an incredible job in Puerto Rico. And whether it s her or anybody else, they re all starting to say it. I appreciate very much the governor and his comments. He has said we have done an incredible job and that s the truth.Here s the video via YouTube.Keep in mind that Puerto Rico just suffered near total devastation. There is a lack of food and water and not nearly enough manpower and equipment. Much of the island still has no electrical power.Blaming the locals is what a poor leader does when he or she wants to shift the blame for their own mishandling of the situation. Trump responded badly to the dire situation in Puerto Rico and he refuses to take responsibility. Apparently, the buck always stops with someone else.

 Bill Oâ€™Reilly Writes INFURIATING Blog Post On Las Vegas Massacre â€“ Itâ€™s Absolutely Vile,"Like increasing numbers of heartless people on the right, Bill O Reilly has weighed in on the Las Vegas massacre with one of the worst things you can say about any mass shooting. The former Fox News host is an avid 2nd Amendment  fan,  meaning he believes that guns are more important than people s lives, and he reminded us that he feels that way in an absolutely disgusting blog post today. The NRA and its supporters want easy access to weapons, while the left wants them banned,  he says. Sorry, but  easy access to weapons  is a big part of the problem. Stephen Paddock had multiple firearms and clips, and over 100 rounds of ammunition. In videos of the shooting you can hear the rapid fire of assault weapons. Guns are already too easy to get.The fact that Paddock managed to kill over 50 people and wound more than 500 more from the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay, which has no balconies or patios, is proof positive that more guns is not the answer. All the  good guys with guns  in the world would not have stopped that. But the above isn t what makes Billo the Clown so repugnant right now. It s what he said afterward, about the price of freedom, that s so vile: This is the price of freedom. Violent nuts are allowed to roam free until they do damage, no matter how threatening they are.The Second Amendment is clear that Americans have a right to arm themselves for protection. Even the loons. Three words come to mind: FUCK. OFF. ASSHOLE. The 2nd Amendment makes clear no such thing. All we can conclude from this is that NRA-types like him no longer value American lives. If they did, they d be calling up all their Congresspeople (like we all should be doing right now) and demanding a thorough review of current federal laws regarding gun ownership to determine how best to prevent things like this in the future. They d be calling their state lawmakers (again, like we all should be doing) and demanding their states do the same thing.The House is supposed to vote on a law that loosens regulations on silencers today. How bad would it have been if Paddock had managed to silence his weapon? It would have taken longer for people to figure out what was happening and even more would have died. But conservatives, both Republican and Democrat, are saying,  Oh, we have to protect the hearing of hunters and sport shooters.  Really? This target shooter knows there are squillions of other ways to do that.  Protecting people s hearing,  is a ridiculous and tone-deaf rationalization for what they re about to do. Lives lost in senseless massacres like this should never be the price of freedom. Any freedom.The time to debate gun laws is after gun violence.The time to debate climate change is after hurricanes.The time is now.#Resist  Alt Sarah H.

 Country Guitarist Who Survived Vegas Shooting Changes Mind On Gun Control: â€˜How Wrong I Wasâ€™,"Caleb Keeter, a lifelong proponent of the Second Amendment, and guitarist for Texas country outfit the Josh Abbott Band has had a strong change of heart regarding gun control. What changed his stance was  the events of last night  in which a gunman opened fire killing 58 people and injuring 515 others, marking it as the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. While  thoughts and prayers  are offered by the masses after each deadly shooting, Keeter took it a step further, posting a lengthy message on Twitter to express his personal thoughts after the attack.Keeter, who survived the attack, wrote,  I ve been a proponent of the 2nd amendment my entire life. Until the events of last night.   I cannot express how wrong I was. We actually have members of our crew with [Concealed Handgun Licenses], and legal firearms on the bus,  Keeter continued.  They were useless. We couldn t touch them for fear police might think we were part of the massacre and shoot us. A small group (or one man) laid waste to a city with dedicated, fearless police officers desperately trying to help, because of access to an insane amount of fire power.Enough is enough.Writing my parents and the love of my life a goodbye last night and a living will because I felt like I wasn t going to live through the night was enough for me to realize that this is completely and totally out of hand. These rounds were just powerful enough that my crew guys just standing in close proximity of a victim shot by this f ing coward received shrapnel wounds.We need gun control RIGHT. NOW. My biggest regret is that I stubbornly didn t realize it until my brothers on the road and myself were threatened by it. We are unbelievably fortunate to not be among the number of victims killed or seriously wounded by this maniac.pic.twitter.com/0NFjHf3PW2  Caleb Keeter (@Calebkeeter) October 2, 2017Some Twitter users wondered about his change of heart. Why now instead of when a gunman opened fire in 2012, slaughtering twenty first-graders and six adults at the Sandy Hook elementary school.On Twitter user wrote,  It s frustrating that some don t call the fire dept until the blaze is at their own front door. But we need more ppl on our side. Welcome. Caleb admitted that he s done nothing about gun violence which has rocked our country for years, but said he would like to do something now. You are all absolutely correct,  he tweeted.  I saw this happening for years and did nothing. But I d like to do what I can now. You are all absolutely correct. I saw this happening for years and did nothing. But I'd like to do what I can now. https://t.co/5mYA7D90X3  Caleb Keeter (@Calebkeeter) October 2, 2017In another tweet, he wrote,  That being said, I ll not live in fear of anyone. We will regroup, we ll come back, and we ll rock your fu*king faces off. Bet on it. It s OK to be for the Second Amendment and for gun control.  Keeter has a set of brass balls to come out publicly like that in support of gun control as the country music industry has close ties with the National Rifle Association.Image via YouTube screen capture.

 Miami Police Union Leader Joins Other Conservatives In Bashing NFL For Las Vegas Massacre,"Over 50 people are dead, and more than 500 are wounded, after a gunman opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers from the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay on the south end of the Las Vegas strip late last night. And true to form, we re already hearing conservatives use it to push their  moar gunz  and  blue lives matter  agendas while crying that anyone begging Congress to do something real to save lives is  politicizing a tragedy. But the true political agenda comes from those who won t acknowledge that commonsense gun legislation would save lives and think that protesting racial injustice is the same thing as protesting against police officers themselves, the military, and the country. The leader of Miami s chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, Lt. Javier Ortiz, tweeted the following:Two groups of people, one in Seattle, one in Vegas, chose to take action last night in their own way . We support the #POLICE pic.twitter.com/2S8WkpWvXl  Miami FOP 20 (@MiamiFOP20) October 2, 2017When the Miami New Times asked him to clarify, he said: While NFL players express a false perception of police officers by inciting hate and division by disrespecting the U.S. flag, the reality is law enforcement risks their lives every day for America. We don t know the motive behind Stephen Paddock s decision to break open the window of a room at Mandalay Bay and then fire multiple clips of rounds into the crowd attending the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival below. As of now, this doesn t appear to have had anything to do with hatred of police officers and we can t say it did until Paddock s motive is discovered.It s true that mass shootings and really, any crime would be worse if it weren t for the law enforcement officers who risk their lives to stop them, but Lt. Ortiz s remarks are dangerously irresponsible because they could trigger a retaliation from the people who worship the flag and think police brutality against African-Americans isn t a thing.And Ortiz isn t the only one who s slamming the NFL because of Las Vegas. Others are doing something similar:Las vegas happened cuz of the NFL players. He said  fuck the raiders  Tyler_Ooak (@Originalkidski) October 2, 2017 No possible motive ??

 Trump: Mass Shootings Will Stop If Americans Unite And Pray For Peace,"Clearly, Donald Trump intends to do absolutely nothing to prevent future mass shootings.The Las Vegas mass shooting is the deadliest in American history. Fifty people are dead and over 400 are wounded after a gunman used a machine gun to mow people down from his hotel room at Mandalay Bay as 22,000 concertgoers fled for their lives.Predictably, the National Rifle Association has remained silent and Republicans like Trump are only offering  thoughts and prayers  instead of taking meaningful action.Trump fumbled his first response to the shooting by offering his  warmest condolences  on Twitter. Of course, we all know that if the shooter were brown with a Muslim sounding name Trump would be calling this an act of terror and would be once again calling for a Muslim ban.But this shooter was an old white guy who used an assault rifle so the terrorism label won t be used and there will be no call for a gun ban by Trump.And that was made further clear by Trump s remarks to the nation this morning as he suggested that the only real way to stop these violent acts is to unite in prayer for peace. In moments of tragedy and horror, America comes together as one. And it always has. We call upon the bonds that unite us, our faith, our family, and our shared values. We call upon the bonds of citizenship, the ties of community, and the comfort of our common humanity. Our unity cannot be shattered by evil, our bonds cannot be broken by violence, and though we feel such great anger, at the senseless murder of our fellow citizens, it is our love that defines us today. And always will. Forever We pray for the entire nation to find unity and peace. And we pray for the day when evil is banished and the innocent are safe from hatred and from fear. Here s the video of Trump s full remarks via YouTube.Not once did Trump call this an act of terrorism. Not once did Trump mention the need for gun control. He said the word  pray  an insufferable amount of times as if prayer is the solution to gun violence. The only thing he offered these victims was prayers and a reference to the Bible and God.That s unacceptable. It s time for Republicans to acknowledge that white men commit acts of terror and it s time for them to ignore the NRA and do something to prevent future tragedies like this from occurring.This was an opportunity for Trump to actually do something courageous in response to tragedy. He failed spectacularly as usual. Thoughts, prayers, and God will not prevent mass shootings. We need gun control measures now more than ever and a renewed focus on stopping home-grown domestic terrorists. The American people need real action, not false platitudes.Featured Image: Screenshot",News
 Geraldo Rivera To San Juan Mayor Carmen YulÃ­n Cruz: â€˜I Donâ€™t See People Dyingâ€™ (VIDEO),"The way in which Donald Trump has handled the aftermath of Hurricane Maria s impact on Puerto Rico, an unincorporated territory of the United States, has been nothing short of terrible and incompetent, leading many to question his ability to even locate Puerto Rico on a map. The only thing more disgusting than the actions of President Trump is the behavior of his blind followers and Fox News reporter and former talk show host Geraldo Rivera set the bar relatively low recently.San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul n Cruz reached out to Trump first by pleading in an interview for him to  save us from dying,  but to no avail. Cruz then tried in the only way proven effective, by taking to Twitter almost a week after Hurricane Maria, the strongest hurricane to make landfall in Puerto Rico since 1928, struck the country and left most of the population without power or fresh water. She began by retweeting the pleas of others and then attempted to get Trump s attention directly:Se or Presidente no eliminar las leyes de cabotaje es inmoral. Es un acto de opresi n financiera que solo lograr  agravar nuestra crisis. pic.twitter.com/6UujyEUlTD  Carmen Yul n Cruz (@CarmenYulinCruz) September 28, 2017Her first tweet to Trump was a plea to eliminate the Jones Act, an outdated and antiquated maritime law requiring all goods transported by water between US ports be carried on US-flag ships, constructed in the United States, owned by US citizens, and crewed by US citizens and US permanent residents, a law that is drastically holding up relief efforts. Cruz s tweet read in Spanish,  Mr. President, not to eliminate the laws of cabotage is immoral. It is an act of financial oppression that will only aggravate our crisis.  It is almost certain that Trump can t read Spanish or comprehend the fact that Cabotage is a real term to refer to coastal navigation and trade, so naturally, he saw this as an insult:The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2017 Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2017 want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2017While Trump put off visiting Puerto Rico for another week, Geraldo Rivera decided to make the trip on behalf of Fox News to see what Cruz was so concerned about. There are all people at all municipalities literally starving, dehydrating,  Cruz told Rivera.  We have had our hospital try to go back to speed but then the electricity goes off and we have to do all the bacteria testing, which takes three to four days. Geraldo wasn t convinced and felt the need to interject. But are people dying?  he interrupted.  I ve been traveling around, I don t see people dying. I spoke to the doctors, they say they saw 53 patients and they had a person who was septic, but nobody dying. Mayor Cruz tried her best to reason with the mustachioed one. Dying is a continuum,  she explained.  If you don t get fed for seven, eight days and you re a child, you are dying. If you have 11 people   like we took out of a nursing home   severely dehydrated, you are dying. Watch the madness unfold below and, in case you were wondering, the death toll in Puerto Rico due to Hurricane Maria stood at 16 as of Sunday with only nine hospitals connected to the electric grid.Featured image via screenshot",News
 NRA Terrorist Organization Remains Silent After Worst Mass Shooting In American History,"It s time to shut them down. Permanently.On Sunday evening, 64-year-old Stephen Craig Paddock poured gunfire on a concert at the Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, Nevada from his hotel room at Mandalay Bay.22,000 people were in attendance. 50 were killed and over 400 were wounded.Paddock fired  clip after clip after clip  from his assault rifle and the carnage stopped when police shot him dead.In Nevada, machine guns are legal and can be openly carried.Stricter gun laws might have prevented Paddock from acquiring the weapon he used to kill so many people.But the National Rifle Association has continued defending gunmen like Paddock for years by arguing that guns of any kind should be in the hands of every American.Thousands of Americans have died because of this irresponsible stance, and you can bet that the NRA will say that  now is not the time to discuss our gun laws  while at the same time only offering  thoughts and prayers  to the victims and their families instead of doing something that will actually prevent future mass shootings.It s a script that we have witnessed time and time again, and it has to be stopped.The NRA has become nothing more than a for-profit terrorist organization that makes money every time an American is killed by a gun. The NRA claims that  good guys with guns  will stop the bad guys from killing us. Tell that to the 50 human beings who were killed.They were just attending a concert when a man started firing from a hotel window. No  good guy with a gun  could have stopped him, but stricter gun laws could have kept the gun he used out of his possession in the first place. The NRA andThe NRA and their bought and paid for Republican lawmakers, including Donald Trump, will claim that stricter gun laws won t prevent such shootings. They are lying, pure and simple.Thus far, the NRA has remained silent about this mass shooting, and Americans across the country are severely pissed off at them.Ya.

 Trump Just Dedicated A F**king GOLF TROPHY To People Who Are Suffering In Puerto Rico,"Some are saying that Trump has not botched the relief effort in Puerto Rico (Newsflash: He s botched it horribly), but even if that were true, he s doing worse than botching the PR for it. Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico on Sept. 20. On the 22nd, he decided to go golfing for four days, and rage-tweeted at the NFL the whole time. Then he rage-tweeted at the  ingrates  in Puerto Rico who aren t showing him the proper appreciation for what he s not doing. Today, he was at the Presidents Cup golf tournament, avoiding real work and participating in the trophy presentation instead.And while he was there, he decided to dedicate the trophy to the victims of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. According to Steve Kopack of CNBC, Trump said that conditions in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico are  really under control,  and that he was dedicating the trophy to victims of storms:For those asking, President Trump was speaking on @GolfChannel s coverage of the Presidents Cup trophy presentation.  Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) October 1, 2017Here are his own words: On behalf of all of the people of Texas, and all of the people   if you look today and see what is happening, how horrible it is but we have it under really great control   Puerto Rico and the people of Florida who have really suffered over this last short period of time with the hurricanes, I want to just remember them.And we re going to dedicate this trophy to all of those people that went through so much that we love   a part of our great state, really part of our great nation. Because a trophy is seriously what they need right now. Forget disaster relief funds, forget personnel and equipment. Forget food, water and medicine. Forget restoring electricity and communications. What they really need a participation trophy, which is what this amounts to for all the good it ll do.The relief effort is disastrously inadequate in Puerto Rico, where people are starting to suffer from Dengue fever, viral conjunctivitis and Zika. They re at increasing risk for cholera due to the lack of clean drinking water. In fact, the number of people without access to clean drinking water has shot from 44 percent to 55 percent between Wednesday and yesterday, and will continue to rise until we actually get our butts moving with the relief effort there.Furthermore, the contaminated floodwaters are putting Puerto Ricans at risk for hepatitis A, meningitis and salmonella, even if they don t drink it.This isn t just a meaningless gesture, it s damned insulting. You don t dedicate a goddamn trophy, presented at a tournament full of wealthy people who are safe in their well-moneyed cocoons, to hurricane victims. You just don t. It wouldn t be surprising to start hearing more outcry from homeless, sick, and suffering Puerto Ricans   people who are already angry at the lack of response from Trump s administration and his characterization of them as lazy all over Twitter.Featured image via Elsa/Getty Images",News
" 49ers Defy Trump, Kneel During Anthem In Solidarity With Colin Kaepernick (VIDEO)","Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has been essentially blacklisted in the NFL for daring to kneel during the national anthem in order to protest police brutality against people of color. He was the original player to #takeaknee, and has paid dearly for it. However, since Donald Trump has seen fit to attack anyone daring to protest in this way, the tide on the anthem protests has taken on new life. After Trump s original attacks, players throughout the league were taking knees last Sunday. The attacks continued from Trump this week, and players continued to defy Trump. Perhaps most notably, those on Kaepernick s old team.The 49ers had an entire row of players kneeling during the anthem, right in front of those who chose to stand. However, despite choosing to stand, those players had their hands on the shoulders of those kneeling in solidarity. Trump might continue to petulantly tweet at these people who are using their public platform to shine a light on the very serious and deadly issue of police brutality, but clearly things are not going in the way he had hoped.Then again, Trump seems to think that everyone is as tone deaf and racist as he and his mouthbreathing, flag-soaked base are. That is clearly not the case, though. Newsflash, you orange fascist   the world is much less tolerant of bigotry than you might like to think. People are sick and tired of your screaming racism through your bullhorn and using the bully pulpit of the White House to attack anyone who would dare to do the right thing here.Good on these brave players. They ll surely be attacked for what they are doing once again, from Donald Trump s overly active Twitter account.

 Tea Party Superstar Gets WRECKED After Obama â€˜N****râ€™ Tweet,"Tea Party darling and deadbeat dad extraordinaire Joe Walsh managed to be douchier than is typical on Sunday when he attacked Michael Che for saying something mean about Donald Trump.It may seem nonsensical that the  fuck your feelings  crowd gets sad every time someone says something to  trigger  them, but Walsh apparently needs a safe space after SNL s Michael Che called Donald Trump a  cracker  (among other things).Like all conservatives at some point in their lives, Walsh became  economically disenfranchised  (the media s term for racism among Trump voters) enough upon hearing Trump described as a  cracker  (the name of an all-white minor league baseball team in Atlanta, Georgia in the early parts of last century) to bust out the  n*gger  word.Naturally, The People were not amused:You thinking there is any equivalence between those two words demonstrates how thoroughly out of touch you are.  bob clendenin (@bobclendenin) October 1, 2017Why do white conservatives want to say that word so bad?

I, a white man, feel that Donald Trump is a willfully ignorant, racist, xenophobic, bathmophobic, traitorous cracker who wants to have sex with his daughter and has said as much on many occasions. The same goes for Mr. Walsh (possibly without the bit about incest fantasies), who habitually fails to pay child support and probably smells like bourbon and the booths at a sketchy adult video store the majority of the time.If Mr. Walsh wishes to fire back, I regularly receive love letters calling me a  Jew.

 WATCH: Kamala Harris Takes Trump To The Black Church In SCATHING Takedown Of His Attacks On Black Athletes,"Everyone is fed up with Donald Trump s blatant racism with his disgusting attacks on black athletes who are using their platform to shine a light on the deadly racist policing problem in America. Case in point   Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA). Senator Harris is one of the few women of color in the United States Senate, so this definitely hits close to home for her. On Sunday morning, while speaking at an Atlanta Church, Senator Harris ripped Trump for his attacks, all the while eloquently and passionately going to bat for the players who are exercising their First Amendment rights. She told the congregation at the First Congregational Church: Let s speak the truth that when Americans demand recognition that their lives matter, or kneel to call attention to injustice, that that is an expression of free speech, protected by our Constitution, and they should not be threatened or bullied. When we sing  The Star-Spangled Banner,  we rightly think about the brave men and women from all backgrounds who proudly defend the freedom of those they may never meet and people who will never know their names. When we sing  The Star-Spangled Banner,  we also think about those marching in the streets who demand that the ideals of that flag represent them too. That s exactly right. America is a wonderful ideal, but it isn t applied to everyone equally. That often has deadly consequences, and we see this racist pattern over and over again. That flag belongs to all of us, and until things are truly equal, it is not just a right to protest this injustice. It is a responsibility. Sure, the racists of America would have us believe that the flag and the nation belong to them. They want people to remain second-class citizens. Of course, they will never say it. Instead, they want to pretend that the last 52 years erased the attitudes that contributed to the white supremacy upon which this nation was founded.We all know that it isn t true, though. Good on Kamala Harris for speaking truth to power. She will surely be attacked by Trump, but this strong woman of color will not be intimidated by that orange fool.Watch her epic speech below:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News
" NBA Kowtows To Racists, Orders Players To Stand For Anthem","For the last two weeks, Donald Trump has been stoking the fires of racial division in America by viciously attacking NFL stars who have decided to take a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality against black and brown people. Of course, all of that escalated when Golden State Warriors Guard Stephen Curry   possibly the most popular player in the NBA right now   said he didn t want to go to the White House to see Trump. Of course, Trump took personal offense at that, and one of the other big stars in the NBA, LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers, called Trump a  bum  on Twitter.U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!  LeBron James (@KingJames) September 23, 2017Now, it seems that the NBA has decided to, instead of giving their players the freedom to express their First Amendment rights, give in to the racists of the nation, and to Trump s petty, petulant, racist bullying by requiring that all players stand for the anthem. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver sent around a memo that said that all players are expected to stand. Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum says that the pre-game moments should be utilized  to demonstrate your commitment to the NBA s core values of equality, diversity, inclusion and serve as a unifying force in the community. This is disgraceful. The NBA is 82% black men. It is their lives on the line, and the lives of others like them, in this racist society. They have every right to protest peacefully. Sure, stand. Don t f*ck up your basketball career over Trump s controversies. But do it with a Black Power fist in the air.Featured image via Ezra Shaw/Getty Images",News
 Rep. Joe Kennedy Torches GOP Congress For Screwing Over Low-Income Kids,"Last night, congressional Republicans went after healthcare for low-income kids and loans for low-income students. Through inaction, they killed the Children s Health Insurance Program, a stunningly successful program that has dropped the uninsured rate among low-income children massively over the two decades it has been active. CHIP has ensured that nine million children were insured who otherwise would not be   and Republicans just let it expire.Here s more from the Los Angeles Times:Advocates for children s health started worrying months ago that congressional incompetence would jeopardize the nation s one indisputable healthcare success   the Children s Health Insurance Program, which has reduced the uninsured rate among kids to 5% from 14% over the two decades of its existence.Their fears turned out to be true. Funding for CHIP runs out on Saturday, and no vote on reestablishing the program s $15-billion appropriation is expected for at least a week, probably longer. That s the case even though CHIP is one of the few federal programs that has enjoyed unalloyed bipartisan support since its inception in 1997. The consequences will be dire in many states, which will have to curtail or even shut down their children s health programs until funding is restored. Hanging in the balance is care for 9 million children and pregnant women in low-income households.What happened? The simple answer is that congressional Republicans  last harebrained attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act got in the way. A funding bill for CHIP seemed to be well on its way to enactment until a week or so ago. That s when the effort to pass the egregious Cassidy-Graham repeal bill sucked all the air out of the legislative room.This is obviously an unacceptable situation, and Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) isn t taking it laying down. He tweeted out an assault on GOP inaction today, helping keep people aware of the incompetence of their congressional representation:Programs GOP Congress let expire last night-healthcare for low-income kids-Community health centers-Loans for low-income college students  Rep.

These are Americans,  Schilling said on Fox & Friends Sunday.  If this were Houston, Texas there d be 55,000 soldiers on this island right now. All have said that the president did everything in a pace that they ve never seen before as far as him releasing money and releasing assets into these theaters,  Schilling said.  The execution on the ground has been horrifying in some cases. I m a student of military history. I ve never seen anything like this,  he said, adding that the southeast side of the island is totally destroyed.  There are towns that are gone.

Not only was he too slow in responding because he focused more on trying to force NFL players to stand during the national anthem, he has not sent nearly enough troops or equipment or supplies to Puerto Rico. And he is insulting them to add insult to injury.Trump has taken to Twitter to constantly brag about the recovery operation despite his response being worse than President George W. Bush s response to Hurricane Katrina. Puerto Rico was devastated by two Category 5 hurricanes, yet less water and food has been sent to the island.When Trump s administration tried to frame the disaster as a  good news story,  San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz fired back by pointing out that people are dying. Trump threw a temper tantrum in response and suggested that Puerto Ricans are lazy people who won t help themselves.On Sunday morning, Trump lashed out again. While bragging about the recovery effort as if it s the best recovery effort in history, Trump congratulated himself and called Puerto Ricans who criticize the weak effort  ingrates. We have done a great job with the almost impossible situation in Puerto Rico. Outside of the Fake News or politically motivated ingrates,  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2017 people are now starting to recognize the amazing work that has been done by FEMA and our great Military. All buildings now inspected ..  Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2017Again, Trump s response to the crisis in Puerto Rico could be much better and it s certainly not as good as he thinks it has been. Furthermore, Trump insulted Puerto Ricans again. While Mayor Cruz is working to save lives, Trump is busy golfing and rage-tweeting. He is enraged because he thinks brown people should be grateful for what little help he has provided. That s a totally unacceptable way to treat American citizens.

 Trump Tries Shaming NFL With Video Of Hockey Fans Standing For Anthem And Humiliates Himself,"After an epic Twitter tantrum in which he yelled at Puerto Rico for being knocked down by two hurricanes and cried giant crocodile tears about  fake news,  Trump decided he d try shaming the NFL with a video from an NHL game. At that game, the audience stands up and sings the national anthem. One might think that this just happened, but it didn t. The video in question is almost a year old.19,000 RESPECTING our National Anthem! #StandForOurAnthem?? pic.twitter.com/czutyGaMQV  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2017The original video is on NHL on NBC Sports  Facebook page, dated Nov. 9, 2016. The day after the election that gave us this walking shitshow to begin with. Why does this matter? Because Trump is still going on about NFL players kneeling during the anthem on Twitter. Earlier today, in the midst of all the ranting about nobody giving him his due credit for the farce of a relief effort in Puerto Rico, he tweeted this:Very important that NFL players STAND tomorrow, and always, for the playing of our National Anthem. Respect our Flag and our Country!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2017He brought the issue into sharp relief last week when he went on a tear about  disrespect  to the flag and called on NFL owners to fire players who won t stand. Many NFL players retaliated by kneeling, the Pittsburgh Steelers didn t even come out of the locker room, and many owners issued statements rebuking Trump in one way or another.So Trump, in an attempt to shame what the NFL is doing now, shares a video that s a year old. In truth, the NHL seems rather split on how they feel about kneeling during the national anthem. There are, however, several players and coaches who believe it s everyone s right to protest how they see fit, as part of the First Amendment. Trump just embarrassed the hell out of himself.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News
 Donald Trump Congratulates Himself On Winning Election And Asks For Donations While Puerto Ricans BEG For Help,"During a time of national crisis, most presidents focus on helping people in need. But not Donald Trump. Instead, he is sending out mass text messages to stroke his own ego and try to raise money. He keeps telling his fans that if they don t keep donating, their big election upset will all be for naught. Here are the texts he sent to his most ardent fans (and a few people who just subscribe for the lulz):Now, to put this into context, the people of Puerto Rico are literally dying. Trump has, instead of trying to help them, attacked the mayor of San Juan on Twitter for begging for help to save the lives of the Americans who live there, and his disaster response has been abysmal, because, you know, brown people. And now, he sends out lying mass communications pretending that he has helped people and delivered on promises when he has done no such thing. Hell, there is plenty of evidence that there was even a point in time when Trump didn t even realize that the people of Puerto Rico are American citizens.In short, this is a man who is raising money off the backs of suffering and dying people, and using the protests of NFL players who want to use their platforms to shine a light on the injustices suffered at the hands of law enforcement by people of color to stoke racial divisions in the nation. In fact, there is even evidence that this part of it was planned. MSNBC s Rachel Maddow explains that bit perfectly:Donald Trump s racist, divisive actions are absolutely disgraceful, and people are literally dying on his watch. This man is not a president. He s a racist and a murderer.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News
" Trump Supporter Tries To Burn Steelers Flag, Hilariously Canâ€™t Figure Out Fire (VIDEO)","Trump supporters have been losing their minds over Trump s assault on the NFL, with many abandoning their teams and publicly destroying merchandise they ll have to re-buy in three weeks when their  boycott  fails like so many others. Claiming to be outraged at nonexistent  disrespect to the flag  while crapping all over the freedoms it represents, conservatives are clearly mad at something.One such Trump supporter is in the video below. For as long as I can remember, I ve been a Steelers fan,  she begins.  But I ve been American longer than that. It s unclear how she knows this, considering we ve already established Steelers fandom as the beginning of her memory. Moving on! Coach Tomlin, I read what you said, and the fact you said that  people shouldn t have to make a choice.  What s the difference between making the choice between stupidity and standing for our American flag?  she continues, executing her poorly-rehearsed lines with all the confidence of someone who does not have a single honest friend. What s the choice between stupidity and standing for those who fought and died? And who stand at the stadium that you re at today and protect your sorry ass? It s unclear what she s talking about. She s referencing Mike Tomlin s decision to keep his team in the locker room instead of coming out on the field before last Sunday s game. He made that decision because he did not want to see his team divided. Before the NFL started taking payments from the Department of Defense to promote jingoistic ( patriotic ) themes, it was common practice for teams to remain in the locker room during the anthem. At the high school and college level, many teams still do.The torture continues afterward, her awkward lines paired perfectly with her body language, which closely resembles that of a broken marionette in the care of a drunken puppeteer: Well, from now on, I m done with the Steelers. I stood for you guys, I fought for you guys, I argued for you guys. Living in Maryland! And this is what I get in return? It s unclear when she  fought  for them guys. Perhaps when the quarterback, Roethlisberger, was accused of rape? Or maybe it was that other time he was accused of rape.She then proceeds to melodramatically rip her Steelers shirt off, uncovering   gasp!  a Trump shirt.  Go to hell,  she says,  all of you. The only flag that s going to fly in my house anymore is the United States flag. At this point, although it s not too relevant to the story, I would like to pause and point out that the person filming the camera hates her. They must, right? It s the only reasonable conclusion to draw from the following two facts: 1) This video was filmed vertically, and 2) This video was filmed. Nobody stopped her. Nobody was like  hey, no, maybe you shouldn t post it to the internet. Yet posted it was. It s at this point in the video she begins trying to light the Steelers flag on fire. Not the Steelers flag,  she absentmindedly adds, beginning her struggle with the confusing concept known as fire. Forty arduous, failure-filled seconds later, and she begins talking again, a nearly invisible wisp of smoke curling from the flag. This is just like a rag now, just like your team. A rag,  she says, holding the torn shirt over the smoldering (ish?) flag, trying to get it to light as well. It doesn t. The flag goes out. And then, she drops the shirt on top of it, perhaps finally confronting failure. Go to hell Steelers. Go to hell NFL. Piss off. God bless America. God bless Donald Trump. God bless America. Done,  she finishes.The whole thing sounds like an incoherent Facebook rant that one too many hillbilly cousins liked before ol  trailer park suburbia Sally here got confident and decided it d make a good video.Watch below:Featured image via video screencapture",News
 Obamaâ€™s Head Of Disaster Relief TRASHES Trumpâ€™s Response To Puerto Rico (TWEET),"It s no secret that Donald Trump s response to the crisis in Puerto Rico has been nothing but disappointing. While US citizens were begging for disaster relief, Trump was staying at his golf club, turning his back on them. The Washington Post ran a story about Trump s negligence last night, stating that Trump went MIA for four entire days while Puerto Rico suffered, focusing all of his attention on attacking NFL players and North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.After seeing the Washington Post s report, a former Obama administration official lashed out at Trump on Twitter, providing the undeserving POTUS with a much needed reality check   and he didn t hold back as he said Trump  makes me so mad I could spit.  Former US Foreign Disaster Assistance chief Jeremy Konyndyk noted how  damning  the report was and tore the Trump administration a new one. In a massive tweetstorm, Konyndyk gave Trump a lesson he ll never forget:        This is one of the most brutal critiques we ve gotten so far in regards to Trump s handling of Puerto Rico.  Malpractice  is truly a perfect word, because Trump really should have been all over this. It is his duty as POTUS   and yet he has almost completely ignored the situation. People are dying and begging for assistance, and Trump has jetted off to his golf course in New Jersey for the weekend. We cannot think of a more self-centered, irresponsible response to a major crisis that has already resulted in the loss of human life. Trump has made it perfectly clear that he doesn t give a damn.America has truly been put in danger with Trump as President of the United States. Puerto Rico proves that he is unfit to lead a country and be responsible for the lives of its citizens.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images",News
" While Americans In Puerto Rico Are Dying, Trump Is Golfing And Tweeting","Hurricane Maria is the worst natural disaster to befall the island of Puerto Rico in nearly a hundred years. Homes are destroyed, families displaced, and an already-suffering infrastructure has been wiped out. Nearly the entire island is without power and more than 1.5 million citizens have no access to clean water, even to drink. And while the people of Puerto Rico are desperate for help and they are dying, Donald Trump has been golfing.That sounds horrible, and it is. It is fucking horrible.It s not new, it s not surprising, and it seems at this point to almost be intentional. There are some who believe his inattention is intentional, and it s pretty hard to disagree.Besides the fact that Trump was nearly a week late in even addressing the horror in Puerto Rico, he couldn t seem to stay focused while there were any football games on television   he can t stop tweeting about players sitting or kneeling during the national anthem. And now that he has turned his attention in at least a nominal way to the people of Puerto Rico, he is furious that anyone would be criticizing his response to the disaster.How can people help but criticize? When the hurricane made landfall, Trump promised all the federal resources the island could want, and understandably, that made people expect him to do that. But then he and his inner circle were invisible for four straight days, including   you guessed it   going on a golf weekend in New Jersey. He didn t take a single meeting about Puerto Rico while he was in Bedminster that weekend, instead dedicating 100 percent of his non-golf time to NFL tweets.Now Trump has a club in his hand again. It s not like he doesn t know how insensitive and irresponsible it looks to go golfing while there s an emergency happening. It s been scarcely more than a year since he criticized Barack Obama for doing just that:President Obama should have gone to Louisiana days ago, instead of golfing. Too little, too late!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 23, 2016The Mayor of Puerto Rico s capital city, San Juan, has been on television literally begging for help.

 Trump Throws A Hissy Fit At His Golf Course As Criticism Over Puerto Rico Response Grows,"The people of Puerto Rico, who are American citizens, are dying. Yet Donald Trump is whining from his golf course like he s the victim.It has been ten days since Puerto Rico was devastated by Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria, but Trump is only just responding to the tragedy. In fact, Trump spent more time bashing the NFL than he has talked about Puerto Rico. And then he excused his slow response by blaming it on the ocean and  big water. Trump and his team have insisted that all is well in Puerto Rico and that it s really a  good news story. That infuriated San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who slammed the Trump Administration by pointing out that this is a  people are dying story. On Saturday morning from his luxury golf course, which is the second time he has gone golfing since Puerto Rico was hit, Trump attacked Cruz and suggested the people of Puerto Rico should help themselves.The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump.

 Neo-Nazi Website Loses Its Domain AGAIN And Its Nazi Owner Is Losing His Damn Mind,"Poor Andrew Anglin, the Nazi behind the website the Daily Stormer. He just can t catch a break. U.S. web hosts, along with Google, decided to drop his site after the Charlottesville riot because he mocked Heather Heyer, who was murdered there by a white supremacist. Ever since then, he s bounced the site from country to country, trying to find someone who will have him. The Daily Stormer has been shut down in China and Albania, and appeared on a Russian domain for a few hours but even Russia wasn t having it. Most recently, Anglin has had his website on a domain registered in Iceland, and Iceland just became the latest country to shut him down.Iceland has pretty stringent hate speech laws, but that s not why they shut him down. According to the Reykjavik Grapevine, ISNIC, the registry company for .is domains, shut him down over a different violation of their terms of service. Jens Petur Jensen, the CEO of ISNIC, said: Our terms of service are very clear. All registrants must provide proof of who they are, and where they are physically located. [Daily Stormer founder Andrew Anglin] doesn t want to do that. Anglin is afraid that Jensen will share his information with Icelandic authorities, who will then share it with U.S. authorities. Anglin is in trouble with the law here for harassing and threatening a Jewish woman in Ohio. Jensen told the Grapevine that he would, in fact, do exactly what Anglin is scared of.Anglin, meanwhile, is crying about this over on Gab, an ad-free social media network that appears to work like Twitter. And he s completely lost control. It would be hilarious if it weren t so sad:Gee, one might think he wouldn t have to worry about any of this if he weren t spreading hate speech and propaganda. Or harassing and threatening people. But that s ridiculous. Anglin is a Nazi, and like all the Nazis and KKK members and other white supremacists, hate is in his blood. Our hearts bleed pink carbonated peanut butter for the fact that he s having trouble keeping his website up.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images and Gab",News
" Trump Is Too Incompetent To Handle Disaster On An Island, But Obama Handled One Just Fine","Trump has spent an awful lot of time whining about Puerto Rico being an island with a devastated infrastructure, claiming that s the reason our relief effort has been so slow and disorganized: The response and recovery effort probably has never been seen for something like this. This is an island surrounded by water. Big water. Ocean water. He also said: This is a thing called the Atlantic Ocean. This is tough stuff. Gee, these complaints are reminiscent of when he said nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated. With this administration,  It s really difficult, we re doing all we can,  is code for,  I don t really care about this at all unless I can find a way to make myself look good here. But are we really having problems because Puerto Rico is an island, making it different than Florida and Texas, which were also devastated by hurricanes? Current evidence suggests otherwise: Supplies are just sitting in shipping containers there because there are too few truck drives, and too many blocked roads. One has to wonder why we don t have more personnel there helping the Puerto Rican government to clear the roads so that supply lines can reopen and we can help get those supplies to where they re most needed. One person even said that the personnel who are there just seem to be modeling their uniforms. That suggests we have a lot of people who don t know what they re supposed to be doing on the ground there. That would be a failure on our part, not Puerto Rico s.But then there s how Obama handled natural disasters on islands. In 2010, Haiti, which is practically next door to Puerto Rico in the Caribbean (not the Atlantic Ocean), suffered an absolutely devastating earthquake. Despite the fact that we had no warning for that quake (we had plenty of warning for Maria), President Obama mobilized our military  as if it were going to war,  according to the Washington Post. Within two days, we had 8,000 troops on their way to the disaster-stricken country.In less than two weeks, we had 22,000 troops on the ground; 300 military helicopters dropping supplies, and 33 Navy ships aiding the relief effort. Eight days after Maria swept over Puerto Rico, we only had 4,400 troops working relief there, along with 1,000 members of the Coast Guard. Only 50 choppers were working to deliver supplies.The morning after Haiti s quake, Obama told the military that they were  going to respond in Port-au-Prince robustly and immediately, and that gave the whole government clarity of purpose.  Rajiv Shah, who led USAID when the earthquake struck, said: We were able to move more quickly in a foreign country, and with no warning because it was an earthquake, than a better-equipped agency was able to do in a domestic territory. The Posse Comitatus Act places limits on what the military can do in a state or territory, and by contrast, Haiti is a foreign country. Our military response would be considerably different just because of that. But there were over 17,000 troops from 23 states on the ground in Florida after Irma. And the administration keeps saying that Puerto Rico isn t asking for very much, despite residents running out of food, drinkable water and other supplies, and San Juan s mayor breaking down over the Trump administration saying the response has been good.There are complicating factors, it s true. But this is a level of apathy and ineptitude we can t have from the White House when responding to disasters, particularly those where people are dying. Obama showed that being an island is a lot less of a factor in relief efforts than this administration is claiming.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla and Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News
 Trumpâ€™s HHS Secretary Stole Over $1 Million From Taxpayers And Now Heâ€™s Unemployed,"Donald Trump ran and won on a platform of  drain the swamp.  He supposedly meant that Washington was corrupt, and that nobody in the establishment could be trusted. However, he has run the swampiest of Washington swamps that America has seen since the Watergate scandal with President Richard Nixon. Case in point- his Health and Human Services Secretary, Tom Price, being mired in scandal for taking hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of trips around the nation and world in private jets on the taxpayer dime. He has sworn, now that he is caught, to pay back every dime to taxpayers over this scandal of luxury, but that was never true. Taxpayers paid over a million dollars for these trips, but we re only getting reimbursed for Tom Price s personal seats.Well, it seems that the news coverage has gotten the best of Price, because we all know how much The Donald wants to be loved by cable news. As such, the news coverage made Trump and his administration put more pressure on Price, and that pressure has worked. Tom Price has now resigned as Health and Human Services Secretary.Under all the pressure from the public and the press, as per usual, the White House is in hiding. They released a simple statement: Secretary of Health and Human Services Thomas Price offered his resignation earlier today and the President accepted. And, in case you were wondering, no, neither Sarah Huckabee Sanders nor any other Trump Administration official came to a camera to discuss this huge development, which comes on the heels of a humiliating defeat in the FOURTH attempt from the GOP-led Congress and the Trump Administration to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. All this proves is what Democrats have been saying about Republicans all along   they are corrupt, and they are incapable of change and of governing.

 Trump Once Laughed About Being More Worried About A Marble Floor Than A â€˜Dyingâ€™ Man,"Trump, sometimes, is honest about who and what he is   a miserable excuse for a human being. Many of these instances of honesty come from interviews on The Howard Stern Show, which he often visited when he never thought he d actually run for president. One such instance, which can be listened to below, includes him laughing about his refusal to help a man who may have been dying, being more worried, in his words,  about the marble. In a video published by Now This on Facebook, you can hear Trump saying,I was at Mar-A-Lago and we had this incredible ball   the Red Cross Ball. You have all these really rich people. And a man, about 80 years old, a very wealthy man, a lot of people didn t like him   he fell off the stage. This guy falls off, right on his face, hits his head, and I thought he died.

 New Mexico Is Erasing Actual Science From Their Science Standards," Education standards,  it seems, is now a term fraught with intent. By and large, standards are set by the states that uphold them, with localities left to decide how best to implement those standards through lesson plans, specialized curriculum, and testing. But if you re a voter, you have at some point checked a box on a ballot for someone on a school board, or at the very least a school superintendent. That means that in a time like now, when the phrase  all politics is local  has taken on the most literal meaning you can imagine, local politics can sometimes determine what your children learn.To make matters worse, textbook manufacturers are as subject to political winds   and capitalism   as the next industry. That means they want to produce their books in markets where they can sell the most, which gives big states like California and Texas, whose student populations vastly outmatch those of other states, huge influence over education standards even outside their borders.When a state is reliably  blue,  as California is, that can shake out favorably for proponents of science, history, civics   basically everything where facts are involved. But when a state is more often  red,  as in the case of Texas, it can be bad for those same things.What happens, though, when a state is more  purple,  like New Mexico?We re finding out now. The new science education standards for the southwestern state are raising eyebrows, and that s saying something for a state in which the long-serving Public Education Secretary resigned after 7 years on the job. Hanna Skandera, who was appointed by Republican governor Susana Martinez, had faced intense scrutiny from both Democratic lawmakers and from teachers in the state over previously proposed education reforms.  A through F   grading for young elementary students and a variety of other changes Skandera had sought while serving in the same capacity in Florida under governor Jeb! Bush made her a target of teachers  unions and parent groups across the state.Martinez was very unhappy about the pressure that caused Skandera to resign.But the proposed changes to science in New Mexico were initially based on the Next Generation Science Standards, guidelines released back in 2013 and eventually passed by both chambers of the New Mexico legislature. It was when the proposed changes made it to Governor Martinez  desk that issues arose. She vetoed the bill, citing her authority to properly  vet  the new standards.Now those standards look considerably different than what the legislature passed.Mother Jones outlined some of the changes:Two Democrats in the state, representing Districts 10 and 33, have pointed squarely at Governor Martinez in an op-ed in the Las Cruces Sun-News:During one of the committee hearings, a former member of her staff admitted the reason for the governor s decision.  Toward the end of my tenure at the Public Education Department, I was tasked to edit and change some of the language in the standards to make them politically sanitized. No matter whether changes come from school boards, legislatures, or directly from a governor s office, changes to education standards should never be politicized. Unless this is stopped, New Mexico is just setting a new standard for how other states might politicize them in the future.Featured image via Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images",News
" WATCH: Adviser Who Wrote Trumpâ€™s Tax Plan Says You Will Be Able To Buy A NEW Car For $1,000","Gary Cohn, a Goldman Sachs recruit, now serving as Trump s White House economic adviser and has assets worth $252 million to $611 million, says that under the former reality show star s tax plan you can buy a brand new car for $1,000, but that s not all, folks, In addition to that, you can renovate your entire kitchen for $1,000. And you can buy a UNICORN for just five bucks, and all because Trump is the best person ever!Cohn took the podium to tell voters about all of this good news which has to be for real because Trump is going to MAGA so hard, you ll also be able to take your family on a vacation for $1,000. Are you getting goosebumps, too? If we allow a family to keep another $1,000, they can renovate their kitchen, they can buy a new car, they can take a family vacation,  Cohn said.Maybe Cohn meant you can take your family on a vacay in your basement for $1,000.

People just like Gary Cohn. In fact, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that the top 1 percent of Americans would get half of the tax cuts under Trump s plan. By eliminating the estate tax, the plan would benefit Trump, his family, and other wealthy Americans. So, now we know why Trump was so vague during his short speech in Indiana on Wednesday.We re wondering what Mr. Fancy Pants thinks a new house costs. By the way, the estimated average transaction price of a new car or truck in 2015 was $33,560. We re sure that s higher now. Mr. Cohn was only off by $32,560. He was soooo close. Missed it by that much! The average cost to renovate a kitchen is actually $21,797. According to American Express, the average vacation expense per person in the United States is $1,145, or $4,580 for a family of four.Image via screen capture. ",News
 High Schools Start Caving To Trump â€“ Will Punish Athletes Who Wonâ€™t Stand For National Anthem,"As if Trump calling for a private organization to fire people who refuse to stand for the national anthem wasn t bad enough, it now seems that some high schools have decided to follow his dangerous lead. Parkway High School, in Bossier, Louisiana, will start punishing football players who won t stand for the national anthem. They could face less playing time or getting kicked off the team entirely.Waylon Bates, Parkway s principal, says that they  require students to stand in a respectful manner throughout the National Anthem during any sporting event in which their team is participating. Failure to comply will result in loss of playing time and/or participation as directed by the head coach and principal. Continued failure to comply will result in removal from the team. Parkway High School is committed to creating a positive environment for sporting events that is free of disruption to the athletic contest or game. And it has begun.High schools are now following Trump s order.Will kick off any players who don t stand during the National Anthem. pic.twitter.com/lfNWyW7z5f  Shaun King (@ShaunKing) September 28, 2017CBS News says that Bates is trying to keep politics out of his schools athletics. He accomplished the exact opposite with this letter, though. In fact, there s a chance now that this will only spur black athletes and their allies to do exactly what Bates does not want them doing.Evidently, the Louisiana High School Athletic Association allows schools to set their own rules about this kind of thing, so other high schools may or may not follow suit here. But the school doesn t seem to care about anything except forcing students to worship the flag. This is one of the replies to Shaun King s tweet:Called them- said constitution doesn t apply to extracurricular activities. Seriously- they said that.  td_port (@td_port) September 28, 2017Too bad for the school that case law seems to be on the side of any students who wish protest, well, anything by not standing for the national anthem. Almost 75 years ago, in the midst of WWII, the Supreme Court delivered a 6-3 decision stating that public school systems cannot require students to salute the flag in West Virginia State Board of Education et al v. Barnette et al. This decision reversed an earlier SCOTUS decision upholding the ability of schools and districts to do that exact thing.This case is generally seen in the context that requiring students to salute the flag can be a violation of religious principles since the plaintiffs were Jehovah s Witnesses. Their religion prohibits them from saluting symbols. The majority opinion, however, barely even mentions religious freedom. Justice Jackson, writing for the majority in West Virginia Board of Ed v. Barnette, tied this to other freedoms protected in the Bill of Rights, rather than making it about religious expression. He held that  freedoms of speech and of press, of assembly, and of worship may not be infringed [on] slender grounds,  and wrote: Censorship or suppression of expression of opinion is tolerated by our Constitution only when the expression presents a clear and present danger of action of a kind the State is empowered to prevent and publish. It would seem that involuntary affirmation could be commanded only on even more immediate and urgent grounds than silence. In this case, Jackson believed that silence didn t  create a clear and present danger that would justify an effort even to muffle expression,  and said: To sustain the compulsory flag salute we are required to say that a Bill of Rights which guards the individual s right to speak his own mind left it open to public authorities to compel him to utter what is not in his mind. Justice Jackson essentially turned the case into one where the government tries to establish its own religion and tries to force its own views onto people; in that case, children. And it could be seen this way in Parkway s case, too, since standing for the national anthem can be considered saluting the flag. The school has delivered an ultimatum to its student athletes: Stand during the national anthem or else.Trump set off a firestorm by calling for NFL owners to fire players who sit or kneel (or stay in the locker room) during the national anthem. Despite the backlash, he s doubled down, and tripled down, and quadrupled down on it, spending a lot of time on Twitter slamming the NFL and completely ignoring the reasons behind the protests (to say nothing of his continued slights to Puerto Rico, which is now in the midst of a humanitarian crisis thanks to back-to-back powerful hurricanes).And now, high schools are starting to weigh in, and it may well be illegal for them to do so. Despite sports being extra-curricular, this is still a school official forcing his students to worship a symbol. And Parkway High School s principal has dragged politics into his athletic program with an ill-advised letter violating the First Amendment rights of students.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News
" Trumpâ€™s Press Secretary Falls Apart, Exposes His Lie About Obamacare Vote (VIDEO)","Anyone who is faced with the unfortunate task of defending Donald Trump s many lies and erratic behavior eventually crumbles. We saw this with former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, and we re seeing it again with current press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.Earlier today, Huckabee Sanders fell apart in front of reporters as she tried to redirect the conversation about Trump s false claim that the Senate has enough votes to replace the Affordable Care Act. When a reporter grilled her on Graham-Cassidy, the GOP s latest health care disaster, Huckabee Sanders practically admitted that Trump had been lying the whole time and that the votes were not there. She said: The point that we re making is that we have the votes on the substance, but not necessarily on the process, which is why we are so confident that we can move healthcare forward and get it done in the spring. Huckabee Sanders, like all of Trump s minions, is well-versed in diversion tactics but still couldn t avoid exposing her boss  blatant lie. Trump does not have the votes to pass Graham-Cassidy, and he was lying through his teeth about it. No matter how Huckabee Sanders tried to conceal the truth, it was too obvious to be hidden.Many   including Republicans   already believe that Graham-Cassidy is dead. If the bill can t get enough votes on the process, the bill cannot pass. Trump lied, and this is just another humiliating failure for his administration and the Republican party.You can watch Huckabee Sanders struggle to hold it together below:Trump can t hide his major failures behind his spokespeople anymore, and his lies are wearing thin. The public is giving him far less leniency now as his approval rating continues to dwindle. Trump s team is in big trouble if they keep trying to cover up his lies.Featured image via Win McNamee  / Getty Images",News
 Wounded Veteran CONDEMNS Trump For Using Him As Prop To Attack NFL Players,"Donald Trump thought he could get away with using military veterans as props to push his political agenda. He was wrong.Marine Staff Sgt. John Jones lost both of his legs in combat in Iraq over ten years ago. In 2007, he sat down for a photograph showing him with the prosthetic legs that allow him to stand and walk.Jones was back in the news this past weekend after Trump shared the photo on Twitter to attack NFL players who kneel during the national anthem.I wonder what this BRAVE American would give to stand on his OWN two legs just ONCE MORE for our #Anthem? #MAGA #NFL pic.twitter.com/3AVqnAlu3F  DONNA WARREN ?? (@DonnaWR8) September 24, 2017As of now, the retweet remains on Trump s Twitter feed.Trump literally exploited a wounded veteran to attack the NFL over protests that have nothing to do with the flag or America s men and women in uniform. The fact is that the NFL players are protesting racial injustice and police brutality. Trump, however, is trying to divide the nation by accusing them of disrespecting the military and the flag.But by using an image of a wounded veteran to push his agenda, Trump opened himself up to being humiliated by those veterans because Jones is very much still alive and able to speak up for himself.And he does not appreciate being used as a political prop to oppose the right to free speech.According to Buzzfeed,Jones says he is sick of military veterans being used as props  to push a political agenda  in the renewed controversy over whether athletes  protests, which they say draw attention to racial discrimination and police brutality, disrespect the military. If you really want to honor the troops, listen to them, he says. Just stop with this sycophantic bullshit and actually do something to support us,  said Jones, who works for Workshops for Warriors, a San Diego nonprofit that has trained more than 400 veterans for skilled manufacturing jobs.  I would want Trump to tweet about that, instead of fueling the fire with the people making 10 million to score a freaking touchdown. And for people (seeing the photo) to say,  Look, he s still standing for this country, and getting veterans good jobs. Jones then went on to defend the NFL players. I ve got my own views about this, but that s why I put the uniform on, so people can do whatever they want in a lawful, peaceful manner. I m sorry, but if you want to know what the real issues are   go to Iraq, or Syria, or Afghanistan, go to places that don t have the freedoms that we have and see how far you get. Protesting during the national anthem is not illegal. In fact, it s protested as free speech and expression by our Constitution. And silently kneeling in protest is peaceful.Even John McCain condemned Trump this week by pointing out that NFL players have the right as citizens to kneel during the national anthem.By using wounded veterans as political props, Trump is the one who is truly disrespecting the military and our nation.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News
 BREAKING: Jared Kushner Is Really A Woman And There Are Documents To Prove It,"You know all those times conservatives have said something ridiculous proves President Obama is gay or Michelle Obama is a man? Each time, they say they have  documents  to back their claims and each time they fail. By this logic, we can now state unequivocally that squeaky-voiced Jared Kushner is really a woman   and unlike when conservatives make similar claims, there are actually documents to back this.In fact, Kushner himself admits he is a woman. According to public records, Kushner registered to vote in New York as a woman in 2009.Prior to 2009, he listed his gender as  unknown  in New Jersey. Naturally, people find this hilarious:Might be cuz he just found out Kushner is registered female voter in NY and cannot have dinner with another women if wife not present!?  jc5502 (@jc5502) September 27, 2017Jared Kushner can't figure out the ""Male/Female"" checkbox on his voter registration form but he'll definitely solve the Middle East.  Chris Jackson (@ChrisCJackson) September 27, 2017#Kushner registered to vote as a female. Was this also due to miscommunications with his assistant? https://t.co/7DlpjC2dWI  Walt Kowalski (@KowalskisLawn) September 27, 2017All joking aside, this is just one more example of Kushner having severe problems with properly completing paperwork. He has repeatedly updated his security clearance forms to include meetings and foreign contacts he forgot about entirely   so it s entirely possible he just got his information wrong and thought he was a female.If Kushner actually identifies as a female, that s cool too. We ll just have to change a pronoun when we explain to people that she s a sniveling little weasel bootlicker with no spine who should spend some time in prison.",News
 WATCH: War Veteran John McCain DESTROYS Draft-Dodger Trumpâ€™s Anthem Protest Whining,"John McCain is far more qualified to comment on the NFL anthem protests than Donald Trump.After all, McCain spent over five years as a prisoner of war suffering brutal torture at the hands of his Vietnamese captors.He is a decorated military veteran who served his country and risked his life.Trump, on the other hand, dodged the Vietnam War draft several times, clearly too much of a coward to fight for America. Thousands of others died far away from home while Trump spent his daddy s money and slept around.So when it comes to choosing who we should listen to when it comes to talking about the NFL anthem protests, John McCain is the most credible.On Friday, Trump called NFL players who kneel during the anthem to protest racial injustice  sons of bitches  and called for them to be fired.Over the course of the weekend that followed and into this past Tuesday, Trump repeatedly attacked NFL players on Twitter.If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017 NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017Sports fans should never condone players that do not stand proud for their National Anthem or their Country. NFL should change policy!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 25, 2017The NFL has all sorts of rules and regulations. The only way out for them is to set a rule that you can t kneel during our National Anthem!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2017But ratings for the NFL remained extremely high, and players responded to Trump by kneeling en masse, something that had not happened prior to Trump attacking them and ordering them to stand.It should be pointed out that the government cannot force anyone to stand for the national anthem, just like the government can t force kids to say the Pledge of Allegiance. Hell, even flag-burning is protected free speech, therefore, so is kneeling.Also, players are not kneeling to disrespect the flag. They are doing so to protest racial injustice.And in one short sentence, John McCain obliterated Trump s whining. That s their right to do what they want as citizens,  McCain told TMZ when asked about the protest.Here s the video via YouTube.Let s keep in mind that Donald Trump himself has repeatedly disrespecting military veterans. During the campaign, he said that McCain is not a war hero because he got captured. Trump also insulted a Gold Star family whose son was killed while courageously saving the lives of his fellow soldiers.Silently kneeling during the national anthem is not disrespectful at all. These NFL players are shedding light on injustice in this country. An injustice that goes against everything the American flag is supposed to stand for. This protest is not about the troops or the flag as Trump claims. It s about injustice and the right to protest against it.Featured Image: Steve Pope/Getty Images",News
 Trump Is So Embarrassed His Candidate Lost Heâ€™s Deleting Tweets And Praying Youâ€™ll Forget,"Donald Trump went all in for his man Luther Strange. I mean, he tweeted   in between other pressing matters, of course   at least a dozen times in support of the incumbent Senator in Alabama.Or at least, Strange was the incumbent, until former Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court and all-around douchebag Roy Moore beat him in a runoff primary last night.Trump did everything but attach himself at the hip to Strange, for a reason I ll get into in a minute. But it just wasn t enough to overcome Moore, who was backed by Trump s former right-hand man Steve Bannon, as well as a bevy of other prominent dumbass conservatives. Sarah Palin, Sebastian Gorka, Laura Ingraham and even Sean Hannity lent their support to the ultra-conservative Moore, while simultaneously being careful to tell voters that a vote against Strange wasn t a vote against Donald Trump. Bannon went so far as to say that a vote for Moore was a vote for Trump.They understand something that the president doesn t, and it s this I was alluding to as the reason Trump rolled so deep with Luther Strange. Donald Trump knows he has some kind of power over his supporters, but he doesn t know what it is. He honestly believes that he can make them do whatever he wants them to do and that they will do it happily. And above all, he believes that he is infallible in his decisions.Trump has it all backwards.In reality, it is Donald Trump who does the bidding of his fans. It s because he literally has no idea what he s doing. He has zero experience in politics. He doesn t know or even care what the people of Alabama think about or want in a Senate candidate. Let me put this plainly:If Donald Trump thought that a man like Roy Moore, who was removed from the Supreme Court of Alabama only by outside forces; who never lost the support of his constituents; who is literally the Bible-thumping, gay-hating, end-times preaching Senator that the most redneck state in America has been dreaming about since Reconstruction was going to lose this election to a career politician, well  He s a whole lot dumber than any of us give him credit for.Trump s candidate lost because he was always going to lose. Trump himself lost because he had no idea. Prior to the election, Trump was so confident of his star power and Strange s ability to win by association that he hadn t bothered to learn Moore s first name.And one thing Donald J. Trump doesn t do is lose gracefully. The president went on a deleting spree of tweets he had posted in support of Strange. He was so angry that he couldn t even remember when the general election was being held in Alabama, so when he congratulated Moore after his win, he even had to delete the first draft of that:Trump has, of course, quieted down. Unfortunately for him, the slew of tweet deletions, which may actually be illegal, just makes his timeline look like literally all he can think about is big black men on their knees.As long as nobody s sitting down during the national anthem, I suppose.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News
 Trump Is So Bad Hillary Is Telling Him How To Be President And Heâ€™s Doing What She Says,"President Donald Trump has had some strong words for his fiercest political rival, Hilary Clinton, over the years, including having his supporters to chant  Lock her up!  at his political rallies, but now it seems that Trump has bitten off a little more than he can chew with this whole  President  thing and needs all the advice he can get   Even if it comes from Clinton. To make matters more amusing, he is actually acting on what she says!As the carnage from Hurricane Maria becomes more evident, President Trump has been a little too preoccupied with perpetually tweeting abound NFL players not standing for the National Anthem, while hardly acknowledging the fact that American lives are in danger after a enduring a week without electricity or clean water in Puerto Rico. On Sunday, Hillary Clinton had had enough of this madness and took to what she assumed was the only platform for getting Trump s attention directly, Twitter, to deliver a very direct message to the President of the United States:President Trump, Sec. Mattis, and DOD should send the Navy, including the USNS Comfort, to Puerto Rico now. These are American citizens. https://t.co/J2FVg4II0n  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 24, 2017Clinton s call for action initially took place on change.org when she set up a petition that received 100,000 signatures in just three days, with critics showing their frustration with the hashtag #SendtheComfort. Both the hashtag and Clinton s tweet specifically mention the USNS Comfort, a hospital ship and, in what could be a simple twist of irony, although that is highly unlikely, Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long announced that that was exactly what the Navy was going to do just two days after Clinton s plea. We re dramatically increasing the federal footprint that s there,  Long said outside the White House, a motion later confirmed by the Navy.Trump himself commented on the difficulty of getting aide to Puerto Rico, but it really didn t sound as if he knew much about the place, let alone where it is, but still claimed that officials were  doing a really good job. It s very tough because it s an island,  Trump said.  In Texas, we can ship the trucks right out there. And you know, we ve gotten A-pluses on Texas and on Florida, and we will also on Puerto Rico. But the difference is, this is an island sitting in the middle of an ocean. And it s a big ocean; it s a very big ocean. The move to send the USNS Comfort came after days of criticism aimed at the US government for failing to truly offer any aide in Puerto Rico, a US territory of almost 3.5 million people, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Large areas of Puerto Rico face months without power and as well as having an exceptionally long rebuilding process ahead of them.President Trump plans to visit the area next week.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News
" The Worst Possible Person Just Won Alabamaâ€™s Runoff For U.S. Senate, And Itâ€™s All Trumpâ€™s Fault","Alabama s Republican runoff election for Jeff Sessions  vacant Senate seat has come to its end, and the candidate that will go up against Democrat Doug Jones in December s general election is none other than Roy Moore. Moore is the former chief justice of Alabama s state Supreme Court, and he s the one who ordered all of Alabama s probate judges to defy the U.S. Supreme Court s ruling on same-sex marriage in 2013.But Moore wasn t Donald Trump s candidate. Luther Strange, who has been holding Sessions  seat, was the man backed by Trump. In fact, Trump was at a political rally for Strange last Friday when he called for NFL players who kneel during the national anthem to be fired. The president s endorsement usually helps a candidate, yet it s Moore who just won. Here s a little background on Moore: He was yanked from the Alabama Supreme Court s bench in 2003 for refusing to remove a massive monument to the Bible s 10 Commandments from the grounds of the courthouse. That s considered a violation of the First Amendment since it constitutes a government endorsement of one religion.In 2012, Moore won his job back, then called same-sex relationships  sodomy,  and decried the immorality of it all in the wake of the Supreme Court legalizing same-sex marriage across all 50 states. He wanted to bar Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison from serving in office because he s a Muslim, and he accused Obama of using our military for social experiments (including wiping out  don t ask, don t tell  and allowing transgender individuals to serve).He has also defended Putin because Putin seems to agree with him on the issue of LGBTQ rights. One might think that would earn him Trump s endorsement, but somehow, it didn t.All of that should have made this election a tossup given conservatives  current love of Trump, but it didn t. Moore was polling ahead of Strange pretty much the entire time. Why?Well, Trump, for starters. That buffoon endorsed Luther Strange and bragged about it all over Twitter, up to and including through today. He boasted that Strange s numbers had skyrocketed since his endorsement, but according to NBC News, Trump s endorsement actually pushed people towards Moore. Trump won Alabama by double digits last year, but it seems they re souring towards him now.That makes this Trump s fault, at least partly. Voters claimed that his endorsement didn t affect them one way or another, but those who were influenced by Trump said he pushed them away from Strange. What that means is that some Republican voters chose Moore because Trump backed the other candidate.That s a massive blow to Trump. Maybe Alabama voters are ashamed of Trump, and they d have good reason to feel that way. For instance, speaking on the  Rick and Bubba  radio show, which is based out of Birmingham, Trump said: Luther Strange is going to be a great Senator. He loves Alabama, he loves the states and he loves the country. He will absolutely win against the Democrat.Ray will have a hard time. If Luther wins, the Democrats will hardly fight. If Ray wins, [Democrats] will pour in $30 million. Moore s first name is Roy. When Rick Burgess, one of the show s hosts, pointed out that he d gotten Roy s name wrong, Trump actually said that it s not a good sign if the president doesn t know his name. Then he said: I don t know that much about Roy Moore. Roy Moore is going to have a very hard time getting elected against the Democrat.Against Luther they won t even fight. When news of Moore s win came out, Trump tweeted the following:As noted above, the general election is December 12. That tweet has since been deleted, and replaced with one noting the correct month for the general.Where is Trump s influence, then? Rosie Gray of The Atlantic said: The outcome of the special election primary will help answer the question of  who is more influential with Trump s base: Trump himself, or the constellation of powerful voices on the right to whom base voters listen and who are supporting Moore? Well, it seems that Trump doesn t have the influence he thinks he does. Especially given that Strange was likely a far better candidate for Senate than Moore ever could be. Moore is an absolute disaster. He s a danger to the U.S., and in deep-red Alabama, there s very little chance that a Democrat can win Sessions  Senate seat. And Trump s endorsement of Strange is partly responsible for this. He s a blight on the GOP and a blight on the nation as a whole. He s dangerous, and Moore s election is evidence of that.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News

 Trump Will Be Furious Because The IRS Is Sharing Info With Special Counsel Mueller,"CNN is now reporting that, after months of confusion over the scope of the investigation into Russian election interference, the IRS is now working with Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his team. The IRS had previously also balked at the no-knock raid on former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort s home at the beginning of August.Those concerns are clearly resolved at this point, as the independent government tax agency is now voluntarily sharing information with Mueller s squad.Mueller and the IRS worked jointly with the Treasury Department to come to an agreement over the matter, which was in question because of the specifics of Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein s written order for the special counsel, which allowed for Mueller to look into  any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.  Mueller s interpretation of that order included years of tax filings, as possible evidence of financial crimes.According to CNN, the IRS had already been working with the FBI on a probe of Manafort before the election, sending criminal investigators to look into potential tax evasion and money laundering. The IRS is also sharing information with Mueller about Michael Flynn, although it is uncertain if Flynn was being investigated for anything similar prior to November.To be perfectly clear, the IRS s previous objections to the Manafort raid were not over its propriety, but whether or not it would interfere with their own investigation of Manafort, whose dealings with former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych made him suspect in almost every way back here on American soil. IRS agents declined to participate in the raid, which Mueller elected to go ahead with using only FBI agents for assistance. Once inside, the team gathered up tax and other financial documents, which have since prompted Mueller s team to warn Manafort that they intend to charge him with tax and financial crimes.All of this, of course, brings back the question of whether or not Robert Mueller will have   or whether he already does have   access to Donald Trump s tax returns. There is little doubt that if the investigation turns up evidence of financial crimes committed by either Manafort or Flynn, the next logical place to look for evidence of collusion is in Trump s own returns.And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the last thing Donald Trump wants.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images",News
 One Republican Senator Is So Fed Up With Trump Heâ€™s Retiring In 2018,"Donald Trump has been a thorn in Senator Bob Corker s side for quite some time, but especially since the mess that was The Donald s disgraceful response to the deadly racist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.

 Four Star General Blisters Trump Over NFL Anthem-Tantrums: â€˜Put Me Down With Kaepernickâ€™,"A backlash has ensued after Donald Trump launched a war against black athletes who choose to sit rather than stand during the national anthem in protest of racial inequality and police brutality. Gen. Michael Hayden, a retired United States Air Force four-star general, who served in the military for 39 years, penned a column which savages the former reality show star over his NFL Twitter tantrums. At first, Hayden wasn t  enthusiastic  about throwing his support behind Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who started the silent protest of kneeling during the anthem.Hayden, who served as national security adviser and head the CIA after he left the military, wrote that the issues Kaepernick raised  were both real and sincerely held. But then Trump crossed the line when he spoke to a crowd in deep red Alabama and called black athletes who kneel  sons of bitches.  Hayden wrote that it s  the way he has previously treated other groups like Mexicans (murderers and rapists), intelligence professionals (Nazis), immigrants (deeply unfair), refugees (dangerous), and Muslims (they hate us). As a 39-year military veteran, I think I know something about the flag, the anthem, patriotism, and I think I know why we fight,  he wrote.  It s not to allow the president to divide us by wrapping himself in the national banner. I never imagined myself saying this before Friday, but if now forced to choose in this dispute, put me down with Kaepernick. Trump lashes out at everyone, especially minorities in order to rile up his base. He literally loves conflict and chaos. When you elect a former reality show star to lead the most powerful country on earth, you re begging for controversy and that s what Trump s base wants. Trump had zero political experience for the job he seems to loathe so much and yet, here he is. Trump uses his Twitter account to divide the nation, and sometimes to try to start a war.After Trump is out of office, we re really going to have to  Make America Great Again  but it will take years to correct all of the harm he s done to this country.Photo: Alex Wong via Getty Images",News
" Trumpcare Is Officially Dead, Senator Collins Confirms Sheâ€™s Voting No","Graham-Cassidy, the latest and worst in a line of Republican healthcare bills collectively dubbed  Trumpcare,  looks dead. Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) just joined Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Rand Paul (R-KY) as one of the few to break party lines and refuse to vote for the bill. While not everyone is against the bill for the best of reasons, Susan Collins could not have been more clear about the many issues she had with the legislation.Here s her statement: First, both proposals make sweeping changes and cuts in the Medicaid program. Expert projections show that more than $1 trillion would be taken out of the Medicaid program between the years 2020 and 2036. This would have a devastating impact to a program that has been on the books for 50 years and provides health care to our most vulnerable citizens, including disabled children and low-income seniors.Second, both bills open the door for states to weaken protections for people with pre-existing conditions, such as asthma, cancer, heart disease, arthritis, and diabetes. Some states could allow higher premiums for individuals with pre-existing conditions, potentially making their insurance unaffordable. States could also limit specific categories of benefits for Affordable Care Act policies, such as eliminating coverage for mental health or substance abuse treatment.Third, physicians, patient advocates, insurers, and hospitals agree that both versions of this legislation would lead to higher premiums and reduced coverage for tens of millions of Americans.The CBO s analysis on the earlier version of the bill, incomplete though it is due to time constraints, confirms that this bill will have a substantially negative impact on the number of people covered by insurance.There has been some discussion that the new version of the bil includes additional money for my home state of Maine. The fact is, Maine still loses money under whichever version of the Graham-Cassidy bill we consider because the bills use what could be described as a  give with one hand, take with the other  distribution model. Huge Medicaid cuts down the road more than offset any short-term influx of money. But even more important, if Senators can adjust a funding formula over a weekend to help a single state, they could just as easily adjust that formula to hurt that state. This is simply not the way that we should be approaching an important and complex issue that must be handled thoughtfully and fairly for all Americans. There you have it   Susan Collins just hammered the final nail into Trumpcare s coffin.On September 30th, a special rule allowing Republicans to pass legislation with only a simple majority (50 votes and a tiebreak) will expire. After that, any healthcare legislation that Republicans want to pass will have to get at least eight Democrats on board.Republicans can t govern or even get their own party to agree, so good luck with that.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News
 â€˜We Know Where You Liveâ€™: Trump-Loving Terrorist Threatens All Who Attack â€˜The White Raceâ€™ (VIDEO),"Meet James Stachowiak. If he looks familiar, you may remember him as the guy who made headlines for telling his fellow  patriots  to shoot black women and children in the heads if they were seen simply exiting a store during the Ferguson protests. If you re unfamiliar well boy are you in for a treat!Stachowiak has by now cemented himself as one of the dumbest human beings on the internet, on par with right-wing agitator Charles Johnson and  alt-right  fake news creator Jim Hoft. In his latest video, the self-described leader of the  patriot movement  (a phrase synonymous with right-wing terrorist groups) has a threat to issue to those he perceives to be  an-tee-fa  (Antifa in English): if you f*ck with  the white race  you re dead. Since we the patriot movement don t see color, I am now going to pull this mask over my face,  Stachowiak tells his fellow  patriots  as he pulls a red white and blue mask down. The sheepdogs are watching you. 200 million weapons in this country possessed by  We the People,'  Stachowiak says.  12 trillion rounds of ammunition and you people don t even know which bathroom  to use? We grow stronger and more outraged every day. You want to destroy this country and the white race,  Stachowiak adds.  We have news for you. The sheepdogs have one mind. We love our country and we want it back. You will never know who we are,  Stachowiak, who posted the video to Facebook under his real name,  says.  You will never know where we are. He then lays out a plan the  patriot movement  has to lure people they don t like into dark alleys and abandoned buildings to kill them.According to Stachowiak, members of the  patriot movement  are stalking those they think are planning  insurrection  and  gathering intel  to use against them. We will use it against you,  Stachowiak says.  We will create panic in your ranks, fear in your hearts, we will cause you to turn on each other like animals. We know where you live, where you work, where you go to school,  Stachowiak says.  We are looking over your shoulder. The sheepdogs are always watching. We are patriots. We are the new Minutemen. We will defend the flock. We will come for you. There will be no rules of combat or as the military says rules of engagement,  Stachowiak says.  There will be nowhere for you to run, nowhere for you to hide You will lie upon the earth until you are buried in it. Don t worry, though. He s not a terrorist. Just loves his country and stuff.Watch it below:Featured image via screenshot",News
" The Only Pittsburgh Steeler To Stand For National Anthem Speaks Out, And Trump Fans Will HATE It","Conservatives cheered when Pittsburgh Steeler Alejandro Villanueva, who s also a combat veteran, came out and stood for the national anthem while the rest of the team stayed in the locker room. They won t be happy with what Villanueva has said about it since, though. They think he s just like them, a jingoist among a sport full of traitors to America, and this is really going to ruin that.First off, it doesn t look like Villanueva intended to be defiant this way:Villenueva asked Ben after Sat night meeting if he could be out in front with captains. Agreed to.  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Villenueva turned around when the Bears fan flag came in, he looked back to his teammates,then the anthem started. He couldn t walk out then  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017So it looks like there might have been some miscommunication about what they were doing, or maybe that Villanueva wasn t totally sure what the team had agreed to do.He also said he knew, every time he saw the flag on a fellow soldier s shoulder during a mission, that they were fighting for each other. He also did say,  People die for the flag; there s no way else to put it  There s nothing else that would justify dying for that mission.  (It s likely the mission he meant was whatever mission he and his fellow soldiers were on, rather than the mission of fighting for the flag that Trump fans are glomming onto).But it s what he says about how he feels about what happened that will have Trump fans seething. Seriously:Alejandro Villanueva:  This national anthem ordeal has sort of been out of control, and there s a lot of blame on myself  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Villenueva: I made coach Tomlin look bad, and that is my fault and my fault only. I made my teammates look bad, and that is my fault only  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Alejandro Villanueva:  Unfortunately, I threw (my teammates) under the bus, unintentionally.  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Alejandro Villaneuva:  Every single time I see that picture of me standing by myself, I feel embarrassed.

Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Alejandro Villaneuva:  I will support all my teammates, and all my teammates and all my coaches have always supported me.  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017And then there s this:Villenueva says he  absolutely  would be OK if teammates kneeled or sat during the anthem.  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Al Villanueva says some players who have been kneeling during anthems have approached him after/before games and thanked him for his service  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Al Villenueva:  Every single one of my teammates is extremely supportive and extremely patriotic. I can honestly said that.  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Al Villaneuva:  The team meeting that we had on Saturday night brought the whole team together. Absolutely, We had great conversations.  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Trump fans really don t understand why people are so angry at them for whining about professional athletes not standing for the national anthem. The jingoism is dangerously strong among them, along with the cluelessness and blind followership. In fact, many of them are on the above thread and totally, utterly and completely misunderstanding it. They aren t the patriots they believe themselves to be.

 Democrat Takes Trump To The Woodshed In Fiery Speech Defending NFL (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is getting absolutely hammered for his recent attacks on NFL players who refuse to stand during the National Anthem in a stand against social injustice. Trump has tried his hardest to pass off those attacks as a defense of patriotism, but most Americans know that Trump is simply trying to mask what are obviously remarks fueled by his own racism   and one Democrat is calling him out for it.Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., blasted Trump on the House floor on Monday and attacked the undeserving POTUS for his pathetic attacks on athletes such as Stephen Curry, Lebron James and the NFL players. In his powerful, fiery speech, Jeffries asked the question that most of us would like to know:  How dare Donald lecture us on what s patriotic?!  You can watch this epic speech below:Just defended @StephenCurry30 @KingJames @Kaepernick7 on House floor. How dare donald lecture us on what s patriotic?! pic.twitter.com/wfbtDajTLD  Hakeem Jeffries (@RepJeffries) September 25, 2017And that s not the only time Jeffries has spoken out against Trump about the POTUS  recent attacks on athletes. In an interview with CNN, Jeffries called Trump a  racial arsonist  and stated that Trump was causing controversy just to keep his dwindling conservative fan base happy and engaged. Jeffries said: He uses race to advance his own ends. We couldn t have said it better. It is no coincidence that Trump s fan base are practically just white supremacists   who he has repeatedly failed to denounce because he doesn t want to lost the only support he has left. Trump knows that his fans are losing interest and patience after all of his broken campaign promises, so he creates these  scandals  and spews nonsense to distract everyone and remind his racist fans why they voted for him in the first place. Trump s remarks about the NFL are disgusting and deserve to be condemned again and again.Featured image is a screenshot",News
 Fox News Just Proved Trump Is Using Fake Video To Try To Start War With Iran,"On Saturday, Donald Trump tweeted a dire warning about Iran test-firing a missile, and proclaiming that the country was  working with North Korea,  whatever that means. The tweet was easy to overlook, since it was part of a litany of unhinged rants about Obamacare, Alabama s special election, a basketball player, the National Football League, and his idea of patriotism.Iran just test-fired a Ballistic Missile capable of reaching Israel.They are also working with North Korea.Not much of an agreement we have!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017Literally 21 minutes later, Trump was back to talking about repealing healthcare for millions of Americans and calling John McCain a coward, and 5 minutes after that, Trump was back to the NFL. Like I said, I don t blame you if you missed it.Thankfully, the tweet is still there. That could come in handy, should anyone decide to do anything about the fact that he was either lying or a complete moron. Or even more disturbingly, that the President of the United States is using fake video to start a war with Iran. Or perhaps Donald Trump simply didn t recognize the exact same footage that he put Iran  on notice  for at the beginning of February:Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile.Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017Fox News, the President s very favorite for of media, is now reporting that the  missile launch  that Trump was referring to on Saturday was in fact video from a launch in January. There was no missile fired on Saturday   Iranian media was simply showing what the missile they included in a parade that day was capable of.Conducting international affairs via social media is nothing new for Donald Trump. It was scarcely hours before he had casually threatened North Korea with total nuclear annihilation via Twitter. By tomorrow, the US may find itself embroiled in World War Three if someone doesn t take that idiot s cell phone away from him.Sadly, nothing would make Trump happier than a new conflict, since wartime presidents are far more popular and important than those who govern peacefully over periods of expansion and global goodwill.That s what war would mean to Donald Trump: Ratings.Featured image via Majid/Getty Images",News

Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) came out on Friday in opposition to the bill. Sen. Rand Paul isn t too keen on the bill either, and Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) haven t taken a position on the bill, but the former is expected to vote against it.Hopefully, today s bad optics will help them to decide because there s a long line of people outside of the hearings being arrested and processed.Image via screen capture.",News
 Target Just Made A Major Move Thatâ€™s Going To Blow Conservative Minds (VIDEO),"Conservatives, who are notoriously anti-labor, are going to be outraged by the move Target just made.Target will be raising their national minimum wage to $15 by 2020, starting with an immediate raise next month. Here s more via Jessica Castro, an anchor for ABC7 out of the Bay Area:#breaking Target will increase its minimum wage nationwide to $15 by 2020; If you work there, this means RAISES next month! #livedesk pic.twitter.com/0BXcHJoBdC  Jessica Castro (@JessicaABC7) September 25, 2017Republicans have repeatedly tried to make the case that raising wages kills jobs and raises prices, but that s not true. Target is making the right call. The current federal minimum wage, at $7.25, is extremely low compared to historic averages when adjusted for inflation.In fact, when you adjust for inflation, the minimum wage has steadily dropped since 1968.Republicans also try to make the case that most minimum wage workers have just entered the workforce and are not supporting families on their income (i.e. are students). This, too, is false. Less than half of minimum wage workers are aged 16-24. Additionally, tens of millions of hardworking Americans are paid nearly minimum wage, and would also be affected by proposed raises. It s not high schoolers with after-school jobs being paid minimum wage   it s anybody working a job at a business that can get away with shifting the burden of its employees to the public.And make no mistake   if you re a taxpayer, you re supporting underpaid employees. People working full-time (or part-time and can t get more hours) who are under the poverty line are eligible for benefits, and many choose to take them, being partial to eating and whatnot. That means if a business isn t paying their employees enough to eat, the government has to subsidize that employee. If a business can t afford a living wage, it has no right to exist.From Pew Research:While the idea of raising the minimum wage is broadly popular, a Pew Research Center survey this past August found clear partisan and racial differences in support. Overall, 52% of people favored increasing the federal minimum to $15 an hour, but that idea was favored by just 21% of Trump supporters (versus 82% of Clinton backers). And while large majorities of blacks and Hispanics supported a $15 federal minimum wage, 54% of whites opposed it.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News
 Republican Governor Helped Kill 11 Elderly People By Deleting Their Messages Begging For Help,"Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms ever recorded, was responsible for the deaths of at least 102 people, 44 of whom were in the Caribbean. Of the fatalities recorded in the mainland US, at least 50 were in Florida, 11 of which were due to the stifling conditions inside a South Florida nursing home after it lost power. Those 11 deaths could have possibly been avoided if Republican Florida Governor Rick Scott had heeded the emergency calls he had received about the worsening conditions in the home.A criminal Probe has been opened into the tragedy at the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hill, a nursing home in Hollywood, Florida, north of Miami, where five bodies were found inside the home itself, with more patients dying later in a nearby hospital. The Vice President of The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, Natasha Anderson, attempted to contact Governor Scott by phone on four separate occasions in the two days leading up to the death of the first patient, leaving a message each time about the worsening conditions inside the home and asking for  immediate assistance.  When Scott s office was contacted in regards to the messages, a spokeswoman said, The voicemails were not retained. In what could amount to possible charges of criminal negligence against Scott, the spokeswoman wrote in an email:  The voicemails were not retained because the information from each voicemail was collected by the Governor s staff and given to the proper agency for handling.  Despite Anderson s claims that she requested  immediate assistance,  Scott has stated that nobody from the nursing home said the patients were in Danger or that the situation was at crisis level.Anderson called Florida Power and Light after the 152-bed facility lost power to its air-conditioning at around 3pm on September 10. FPL said they would have crews dispatched the next morning, but to no avail so on the evening of September 11, Anderson called a cellphone number provided by Scott during a conference call prior to the emergency in which he claimed they could contact him him if trouble arose, however, she was only able to get his voicemail. She tried three more times the following day, met with the same result. Patients at the home began to suffer from a variety of health problems between 3am and 6am on the morning of September 13, some of whom had body temperatures recorded as high as 109 . None of this changes the fact that this facility chose not to call 911 or evacuate their patients to the hospital across the street to save lives,  a spokeswoman noted. I am going to work to aggressively demand answers on how this tragic event took place,  Governor Rick Scott said in a statement.  This situation is unfathomable. Every facility that is charged with caring for patients must take every action and precaution to keep their patients safe. The governor has since shut off the facility s Medicare and Medicaid funding.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News
" People Upset By NFL Players â€˜Disrespectingâ€™ The Flag Do It CONSTANTLY, According To The Flag Code","Maybe you re a little confused, like me, about when exactly the American flag took the place of the First Amendment to the Constitution. After all, I have a sister older than the current American flag. But conservatives sure do like symbols, and their assumption that everyone else does as much as they do is probably why the outrage over NFL players taking a knee, or sitting, or otherwise not properly  respecting  American symbolism has captured the zeitgeist in the country this football season.But what does  respect for the flag  actually mean, and is there a double standard? One Twitter user had a pretty spectacular take on whether there just might be a little hypocrisy at play in all of the criticism of those  ungrateful black multi-millionaires  who dare to protest in a way that s  unacceptable  to white people. HennyWise  is a third generation veteran of the armed forces, and his outline of ways that America completely ignores the  disrespect  that doesn t bother them or even makes them happy is a primer on the United States Flag Code. Setting aside the fact that a significant number of sports fans may in fact be getting a beer at concessions during the national anthem and display of the colors, there are a number of regulations that Americans don t seem to mind breaking:Let s jump right in US Flag Code: Chapter 10.176C The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.  pic.twitter.com/a9niowcX5f  HennyWise (@koopa_kinte) September 23, 2017US Flag Code: Chapter 10.176D The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery.  pic.twitter.com/z3rywoKDtO  HennyWise (@koopa_kinte) September 23, 2017Here s a popular violationUS Flag Code Chapter 10.176I The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever.  pic.twitter.com/OMNzTurFaD  HennyWise (@koopa_kinte) September 23, 2017US Flag Code Chapter 10.176I (pt 2) It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like  pic.twitter.com/xHG3sypUrA  HennyWise (@koopa_kinte) September 23, 2017US Flag Code Chapter 10.176I (pt3) or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard.  pic.twitter.com/WVvQVjD6qG  HennyWise (@koopa_kinte) September 23, 2017Since it s Saturday US Flag Code Chapter 10.176J No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform.  pic.twitter.com/7R8sZmqcp1  HennyWise (@koopa_kinte) September 23, 2017Not covered in the  Respect for Flag  section; standing/kneeling/sitting.

 Billion Dollar Company Tells Employees How Theyâ€™re Allowed To React On Social Media To 46% Pay Cuts,"You may not be familiar with the name  Unilever,  but there is a good chance you have some of their products in your home right at this moment. The multi-national giant owns a lot of the brands many will most likely find in both their bathroom cabinet, such as Axe and Dove, as well as in their kitchen, with brands including Hellman s, Best Foods, and I Can t Believe It s Not Butter. The company also makes Lipton Ice Tea in a partnership with PepsiCo.But Unilever s biggest cash-cow is ice-cream, with an annual turnover of almost $6 billion. The corporation owns Ben & Jerry s, Klondike, Popsicle, and Slim Fast just to name a few, but they aren t the names that are paying the bills   It s what is officially known as the  Heartbrand  umbrella, available in over 40 countries under different names in order to retain a sense of regional familiarity, but always recognizable by its heart-shaped logo. If you have ever eaten a Magnum or a container of Blue Ribbon, you ll understand exactly how they got so big.Like most large corporations, however, it has also been discovered that Unilever is heartless at their core. This was proven after they applied to Australia s Fair Work Commission to terminate an enterprise agreement at its Heartbrand, known as  Streets,  manufacturing plant in western Sydney, Australia. It s a move that would result in workers facing pay cuts of up to 46%. Furthermore, their conditions would depreciate significantly as they would also lose existing limits on overtime, redundancy conditions, and protections against the use of labor hire and contractors among other current restrictions.Now it has come to light that Unilever is also briefing employees on how they are able to react on social media to their potential significant loss of wages and workers rights. A leaked memo from the company to employees states what constitutes the breach of company policy when posting on social media about the situation, covering everything right down to commenting with emojis.Could this two-page document pave the way to further stifling employees freedom to express their dissatisfaction? Read through and decide for yourself: The Australian Manufacturing Workers  Union have also taken on Unilever with their Say No To Streets campaign that allows protesters to email both the Streets Financial Officer and the factory Site Manager directly on the topic.Featured image via screenshot",News
 Zuckerberg Was Personally Warned About Russian Meddling By Obama And He Completely Blew It Off,"As the investigations into how Russia meddled in our election escalate, Facebook has turned records relating to ad buys from Russian actors over to Congress. Facebook has found itself in the crosshairs of Democrats and Republicans alike because of this (and for other reasons), and Mark Zuckerberg is finally, finally wondering if maybe he should be taking a more active role in his own company.Why? Because Facebook sold over 3,000 pro-Trump and pro-right wing ads to fake accounts run by Russians and people with ties to Russia. They turned those records over to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and to Special Counsel Robert Mueller. They re going to re-evaluate the processes they use to review political ads, and they will supposedly  offer a higher standard of transparency  on those ads than what the law requires for radio, television and other platforms.For many, it s too little, too late, though. Trump was elected, a hostile foreign power helped him win, and the true scope of how Russia used and manipulated Facebook is still unknown. When they first came under fire for allowing the proliferation of fake news following Trump s  win,  Zuckerberg s excuse was that they were a technology company, not a media company. The implication was that they couldn t be held responsible for any of that.They re only now starting to come around to the truth, but the sad thing about this is that Zuckerberg was warned about people misusing his platform to swing the election several times. In fact, none other than President Obama himself literally pulled Zuckerberg aside during a conference in Peru to practically beg him to take the threat of fake news and disinformation seriously. Obama told Zuckerberg that, unless he actually paid attention, this would only be worse in four years.But Zuckerberg blew him off. He told Obama that such messages weren t widespread on his platform, and that there wouldn t be an easy solution to it. Like his pathetic excuse of being a tech company, Zuckerberg shirked any and all responsibility for it. Obama tried. Zuckerberg didn t really seem to care.Discovering that another country would even dare to try and influence our elections should be a horrific epiphany for any American. It s true that neither Zuckerberg, nor anyone else at Facebook (or anyone really) could have sufficiently predicted that anything like this would happen. As recently as two to three years ago, most of us would have made fun of the conspiracy theorists making bizarre claims about shady and hostile foreign actors working to swing our elections to their favor. That s reality now, but early warnings like Obama s seem to have slid right off Zuckerberg s back, as he was more concerned with his product than with how his product was being misused.Russia weaponized Facebook, and it s not over. Facebook has its part to do and they need to get to it post-haste. But another part may lie with Washington, with our lawmakers. It may well be time to apply laws similar to those that govern political advertising elsewhere to social media. Facebook hasn t yet provided many details about how they ll be transparent, especially given the fact that many of their political ads don t meet current legal definitions for political ads. They are, however, talking the talk. Now they need to walk the walk, or be forced to do so under law.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News
" â€˜Racist, Fascist, White Supremacistâ€™: Former NFL Star Chris Kluwe Scorches Trump Over His Attacks On Atheletes","Donald Trump is facing seriously fierce blowback for his attacks on black athletes who choose to protest racism and police brutality by taking a knee during the national anthem before games. Everyone from owners to players to players to former players are giving Trump a big middle finger during Suturday s games on Sunday, and former NFL star Chris Kluwe didn t stay out of the fray. During an interview with CNN host Fredricka Whitfield, Kluwe, who believes he was blacklisted in the league for speaking out for LGBTQ rights, did not hold back. First, Whitfield asked: This display of kneeling at the national anthem on a football field started a year ago with 49er s Kaepernick and now has evolved into something else or perhaps has blossomed into the same thing but in a bigger way. Chris, what statement do you see NFL teams, owners, coaches making when they kneel, touch, lock arms on display like this? Kluwe responded: Well, I think that the players and the teams are saying that they are not going to be dictated to by a racist, fascist white supremacist who currently occupies the highest place in our government. When you look at what Donald Trump has said about speaking out against Nazis, I think it s fantastic that players and owners are now taking a stand in using the platform to speak out against this because this is not what America is. America is not a fascist military state where its devotion to the flag above all. Right now our nation is not holding up its end of the social contract, especially with communities of color. It should be a baseline right now that you can walk down the street and not get shot by a police officer for carrying a toy gun or for selling cigarettes out of the back of a car. It should not be out of the ordinary to expect that. So I m glad to see these players and owners taking a stand. Communities of color within our nation are not receiving the same level of justice that white communities are,  he added.  Black members of our society are far more likely to be put in prison for what white members are able to skate by on. But it s also morphed into a discussion that we have a person in charge of our society that does not understand what it means to wield the American empire, and has shown no willingness to work with minorities, with immigrants, with anyone who is not white, and that is, again, against the heart of what America stands for. Kluwe is spot on. These players do not suspend their First Amendment right when they take to the field. Further, Donald Trump should not be using the bully pulpit of the White House to try and get people fired for demonstrating for justice. These players are using their platforms to bring awareness to a very serious, and literally life or death, issue in America s communities of color. There s nothing more patriotic that they could do.Trump, on the other hand, is no patriot. Kluwe is correct   Trump IS a racist, a fascist, and a white supremacist. Kudos to these sports teams for standing up to this bullying.Watch the video below:Featured image via video screen capture",News
 Over 500 NFL Players Plan To Tell Trump To F*** Off Today In The Best Way Possible,"A backlash of epic proportions ensued after Donald Trump launched a war against African-American athletes who protest by kneeling during the national anthem. The former reality show star has managed to piss off players in three major professional sports and even went so far as to call Colin Kaepernick s mother a  bitch.  And even this morning, the 71-year-old  man  crawled out of bed to rant and rage on his Twitter timeline again about black athletes silently protesting. The backlash has been fierce, with the Pittsburgh Steelers announcing that they plan to stay in their locker room for the national anthem before their game against the Chicago Bears. Multiple team members from the Ravens and Jaguars took to their knees during the anthem while the remaining players stood behind them linking arms in solidarity.The Dolphins are wearing  #ImWithKap  t-shirts.The Dolphins have shirts showing their support for Colin Kaepernick's push for social justice and racial equality. pic.twitter.com/OMha2xl0wj  Omar Kelly (@OmarKelly) September 24, 2017 Over 500 players have communicated to me that they intend on demonstrating today,  activist and writer Shaun King tweeted.Over 500 players have communicated to me that they intend on demonstrating today.

Trump blasted the NFL this morning over its ratings but he failed to mention his own. Trump s approval numbers are the lowest of any president in the history of polling.To kneel during the national anthem is not a sign of disrespect toward our country s flag. It is actually respecting what the flag truly stands for and the rights we have as citizens of this country.

 Golden State Warriors Coach Just WRECKED Trump After Attack On One Of His Players,"On Saturday, the man we re forced to call  President  Trump responded to Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry s refusal to accept an invitation to the White House by doing the internet equivalent of incoherently screeching  WELL FINE,  YOU RE NOT INVITED ANYWAY. Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017Unfortunately for Trump, Warriors coach Steve Kerr has Curry s back. The idea of civil discourse with a guy who is tweeting and demeaning people and saying the things he s saying is sort of far-fetched,  Kerr said on Sunday.  Can you picture us really having a civil discourse with him? It was an actual chance to talk to the president,  he said.  After all, he works for us. He s a public servant. He may not be aware of that, but he is a public servant, right? So maybe as NBA champions, as people in a prominent position, we could go in and say,  This is what s bothering us, what can we do about this?'  Then he laid in to Trump for attacking black football players for exercising their First Amendment rights while calling Nazis  very fine people: How about the irony of  Free speech is fine if you re a neo-Nazi chanting hate slogans, but free speech is not allowed to kneel in protest?  No matter how many times a football player says,  I honor our military, but I m protesting police brutality and racial inequality,  it doesn t matter. Nationalists are saying,  You re disrespecting our flag.  Well, you know what else is disrespectful to our flag? Racism. And one s way worse than the other. Trump is a constant embarrassment to our country.Watch Kerr rip him apart below:Featured image via video screen capture",News
 WATCH: Trumpâ€™s Treasury Sec. Steve Mnuchin Says NFL Players Have No Right To Free Speech,"Donald Trump is clearly violating the free speech rights of NFL players, and his weaselly Treasury Secretary supports it.As we all know, Trump has been waging a war against the NFL since calling quarterback Colin Kaepernick a  son of a bitch  on Friday night and demanding that NFL team owners fire players who kneel during the national anthem. On Saturday night, and into Sunday morning, Trump lashed out at the NFL in a tirade that made it clear that Trump opposes free speech and the Constitution that protects it.If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017 our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU RE FIRED. Find something else to do!  Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017 NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017That s right. Trump accused an American business of being anti-American for not firing players who kneel during the anthem in protest of police brutality and racial injustice. In short, Trump ordered the NFL to fire players who exercise their freedom of speech and expression. That means the government is now actively trying to force private institutions to silence and punish free speech.And Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin agreed with what Trump is doing, and even went full hypocrite by defending Trump s vile language. The owners should have a rule that players should have to stand and have respect for the national anthem,  Mnuchin told ABC host Martha Raddatz.  This isn t about Democrats, this isn t about Republicans, it s not about race, it s not about free speech. They can do free speech on their own time. The Constitution protects freedom of speech. This is something that Mnuchin clearly does not understand, which should automatically disqualify him from being in government.When asked about Trump s language, Mnuchin argued that  the president can use whatever language he wants to use.  In other words, white racists like Trump have freedom of speech, but black NFL players do not.Mnuchin then butchered the First Amendment even further by claiming that NFL players only  have the right to have the First Amendment off the field.  And that s complete bullshit. Clearly, Mnuchin failed basic civics in school.Here s the video via YouTube.The government, including the president, can t order a business to violate the free speech rights of their employees. Donald Trump owes an apology to the players whom he offended with his outrageously divisive remarks. No one can be forced to stand for the national anthem, just as no child can be forced to stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. It s unconstitutional.Featured image via video screen capture ",News
 Trump Declares War On NFL In Early Morning Twitter MELTDOWN,"Donald Trump is now obsessed with attacking the NFL.On Friday night, Trump demanded that NFL team owners fire any player who kneels during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and called NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick a  son of a bitch. Seriously, Trump just publicly insulted a private citizen and called for dozens of firings. This is the so-called President of the United States.Apparently, Trump is tired of North Korea not giving in to his demands so he picked a new target closer to home.After much criticism, Trump jumped on Twitter to throw a temper tantrum on Saturday night.If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017 our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU RE FIRED. Find something else to do!  Donald J.

Fire or suspend!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017 NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017That s right, Trump literally just called for a boycott of an American business because it s not racist enough and suggested that the NFL is anti-American for not punishing players for exercising their constitutional rights. Kneeling during the national anthem is a protest against racial injustice, and so far, it has been working. Attention has been brought to the issue. But Trump wants owners to start firing players who kneel or force them to stand, which would likely see a bunch of lawsuits filed against the NFL.Refusing to stand during the national anthem is protected as free speech and expression by the Constitution. It would be like forcing kids to stand and say the Pledge of Allegiance in school, which is what Trump will probably do next after he gets humiliated by the NFL.The NFL can do that by making sure Colin Kaepernick gets signed by a team. And every NFL player should kneel during the anthem in solidarity with their fellow teammates. Their teammates are under attack by Donald Trump now. It s time to kneel together, not just to protest racism, but to protest him as well. Because Trump is the biggest racist of them all.Featured Image: David Becker / Stringer via Getty",News
 Trump Just Threatened To Murder 25 Million People Because Words Offended Him,"On Saturday night, Donald Trump once again casually threatened nuclear war against the country of North Korea. The last time he did that, he came back with an arguably weak package of sanctions, which penalized only individuals doing business with the dictatorship. This time, Snowflake Trump was triggered by North Korea s Foreign Minister speaking at the UN.Ri Yong Ho told the assembly that the week s exchange of insults between Trump and his apparent arch-nemesis Kim Jong Un made our rocket s visit to the entire US mainland inevitable all the more,  apparently threatening to aim North Korean missiles directly at the United States. The isolated peninsular nation, by all accounts, is years away from developing technology that will actually reach us.Trump  fired  back:Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017Trump has now added an adjective to his new nickname for Kim, further Trumpifying  Rocket Man  into what he surely believes is a dagger through the heart of the 33-year-old dictator. They won t be around,  of course, includes the 25 million inhabitants of North Korea, as even the smallest of our nuclear weapons would cause inconceivable damage to the geographically insignificant country.Trump is undoubtedly attempting to deflect some attention away from his weekend misadventures in Alabama, which earned him the scorn of every sports fan in America over his racist call for NFL owners to fire players who kneel during the national anthem.  Unpatriotic,  he calls it. I don t think Donald Trump knows what patriotism is.It certainly isn t making America look like a global bully that takes offense at the most meaningless of statements from a hostile foreign minister.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News
 Former Director Of National Intelligence Says Russia Interference Casts Doubt On Trumpâ€™s Win,"James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence under President Barack Obama, appeared on CNN s Erin Burnett Out Front on Friday night, and he told Burnett just what many Americans have suspected since January. Speaking about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign, Clapper told her that the intelligence community had met with Donald Trump prior to his inauguration. In that briefing, he and other intel chiefs discussed with Trump a joint assessment by the CIA, FBI, and NSA that concluded that the interference was significant enough to warrant concerns over the outcome of the election: Our intelligence community assessment did, I think, serve to cast doubt on the legitimacy of his victory in the election. Although Clapper didn t say it in the interview, the unspoken implication is that this message may have prompted Trump s ridiculous overreactions to his inaugural crowd size, the myth that millions of  illegals  voted in the election, and any number of other actions and statements that led to the creation of Trump s laughable  Commission on Election Integrity,  which has, thus far, served only as a vehicle for promoting voter suppression.Clapper s CNN appearance was timely. It came just a short while after Trump went back to his favorite outlet, Twitter, to vent his frustrations for the millionth time:The Russia hoax continues, now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 22, 2017Unfortunately for Trump, the fact is that the Facebook ads purchased by Russia weren t even part of that discussion with Clapper. Those weren t discovered until recently, after Facebook combed through their ad sales records and discovered hundreds of fake Russian profiles buying pro-Trump and pro-conservative ads on the social media platform during the campaign. That means that completely independent of any allegations about ad buying, the intelligence community had already concretely agreed that Russia helped Trump win the election.Even after the transition to Trump s administration and Cabinet, the investigation into Russian interference produced the same responses from different intel chiefs. When Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, asked Trump s own CIA head and his new Director of National Intelligence whether they believed that Russian intelligence agencies were responsible for the hacks and leaks that led to the investigation, both Mike Pompeo and Dan Coats agreed.Clapper told Burnett that Trump s demeanor during the January briefing has been completely different than his behavior since he was inaugurated, calling the earlier Trump  solicitous, courteous, [and] even complimentary  when he sat down with the agencies.Trump is getting more than a little nervous now, and this interview with James Clapper sheds light on his renewed efforts to brush aside the Russia investigation.Watch:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News
 Colin Kaepernickâ€™s Mother Fires Back At Trump For Calling Him A â€˜Son Of A B*tchâ€™,"On Friday, Donald Trump attacked NFL players such as Colin Kaepernick at a rally for Alabama Senate candidate Luther Strange (R).

 WATCH: Bill Maher Hilariously Explains Why Trump Ditched McConnell And Ryan For Chuck And Nancy," Republicans have been furious with Donald Trump lately. He blindsided them by ditching House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-NY), now dubbed his new friends,  Chuck and Nancy.  However, Bill Maher, host of HBO s Real Time, seems to think that there is a very simple answer to this: Trump relates to  Chuck and Nancy  because he has the big city life in common with them. Using the children s book  The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse  to illustrate his point, Maher says: Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, they re city mice, and that s who a consummate New Yorker like Donald Trump relates to. Maher then goes on to say that, prior to running for the presidency as a Republican, Trump  would never be caught dead hanging around with a traveling Bible salesman like Paul Ryan, or a corny, countrified goober like Mitch McConnell. For Christ s sakes the man is from Kentucky. Jeff Sessions is from Alabama. When he talks, all Trump hears is a tiny little Earnest movie. Maher then takes on Vice President Mike Pence, saying: And Mike Pence? It must be torture for Trump to be in the White House every day with that homespun, Christian, tightly wound human hard on. He literally won t dine with an unchaperoned woman. Meanwhile, Trump has spent his entire life posing with a shit-eating grin that says look at all the pussy I m getting. At the end of the monologue, Maher gives a brutal message to so-called  Real Americans: I hate to break it to you, but what Trump likes about Chuck and Nancy, is that they re not you. This is absolutely true. Before running for president, Donald Trump was a typical New York Democrat. He doesn t give a shit about social issues or religion, and he sure as hell doesn t give a shit about the fools who put him in office. His own kids couldn t vote for him in New York s GOP primary because they were registered as Democrats. He s given bunches of money to Democratic politicians for years. Trump is no Republican. He just knew he could play that side of the aisle for fools, when he d never have had a chance running as a Democrat.Furthermore, Trump would never be caught dead hanging with any of the people who voted for him. And all those countrified middle American women who say that he can grab their pussies any time? Yeah, he wouldn t touch you with someone else s dick.Too bad those voters would vote for this guy again in a heartbeat.Featured image via video screen capture",News
" Trumpâ€™s Making It Harder To Sign Up For Obamacare On Purpose, Even If The GOP Doesnâ€™t Pass Anything","The Trump administration has announced even more impediments to signing up for health insurance through Healthcare.Gov, the website set up during the creation of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Donald Trump has been steadfast in his insistence that Obamacare is failing, despite a wealth of evidence that it is not. So to make it appear as though the ACA is on its last legs, Trump has devised multiple ways to ensure that enrollment is as hard as humanly possible.The latest scheme was first reported by Kaiser Health News  Phil Galewitz:..@HHSGov did a webinar with Assisters today, disclosing its plan to shut down @HHSGov on most Sundays during open enrollment season pic.twitter.com/fOF9AlKFo8  Phil Galewitz (@philgalewitz) September 22, 2017That s right: The Department of Health and Human Services, run by Tom Price, the man currently under intense scrutiny for his unethical use of taxpayer money to charter private jets for personal travel, has announced  downtimes  for the government website, and they are insane. All websites occasionally have downtime for maintenance, of course, but HHS is actually reserving 12 hours every single Sunday during open enrollment that the website will be inaccessible.HHS had already done their best to stifle participation in Obamacare by cutting the enrollment period in half and reducing advertising and promotional funds for the ACA by ninety percent. The Department also cut funding and grants for  navigators,  or health care specialists who help enrollees find coverage that s suitable for them, to the states by forty percent.The new roadblock means that, of the limited time working people actually have to get on the website and sign up, a huge chunk of free time has just been eliminated that could have been used. Make no mistake: The Trump administration knows that Sundays are the only day many Americans have free time. And the signup process, though easy, does take some time to complete.Just like his efforts toward voter suppression, Trump is using the power of the federal government to literally harm Americans who just want to avail themselves of a service that is offered. Hopefully the legions of people who benefit from the ACA who showed up at town halls across the country this summer understand that there is still nothing wrong with the system as it is   other than that it s not single-payer   and will remember Trump and the GOP s betrayal when they head to the voting booth next time.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News
 Trump Insults John McCain For Refusing To Strip Healthcare From Millions Of Americans,"John McCain survived brutal torture and six years as a prisoner of war during Vietnam. If Donald Trump thinks he can intimidate him, he should think again.On Friday, the Arizona senator released a statement announcing his intention to vote against the Graham-Cassidy bill that Republicans have introduced to repeal Obamacare.The bill would strip healthcare from 30 million Americans, and turn Medicaid into a block grant program that would cease to exist after a few years. The bill also gives states the power to obtain waivers so that insurance companies can discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. America s healthcare system would be thrown into dire chaos, and Trump is absolutely okay with that.McCain is not.The issue is too important, and too many lives are at risk, for us to leave the American people guessing from one election to the next whether and how they will acquire health insurance. A bill of this impact requires a bipartisan approach.Senators Alexander and Murray have been negotiating in good faith to fix some of the problems with Obamacare. But I fear that the prospect of one last attempt at a strictly Republican bill has left the impression that their efforts cannot succeed. I hope they will resume their work should this last attempt at a partisan solution fail.I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal. I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried. Nor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost, how it will effect insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it. Without a full CBO score, which won t be available by the end of the month, we won t have reliable answers to any of those questions.And for that, Trump viciously attacked McCain.John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill, which his Governor loves. He campaigned on Repeal & Replace. Let Arizona down!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017Arizona had a 116% increase in ObamaCare premiums last year, with deductibles very high. Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods. Sad  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do. Better control & management. Great for Arizona. McCain let his best friend L.G. down!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017First off, block grants are not enough to cover all the people who desperately need healthcare. In fact, it limits funding to the point where state officials will have to decide who gets care and who doesn t to avoid using up the grant money on expensive treatments, which sounds a lot like a death panel.Second, Lindsey Graham s friendship with McCain does not mean they vote the same, as Graham made clear on Twitter.My friendship with @SenJohnMcCain is not based on how he votes but respect for how he s lived his life and the person he is.  Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 22, 2017Obamacare has its flaws, but those flaws can be fixed easily with bipartisan legislation. McCain understands this and he understands that repealing Obamacare would leave tens of millions of Americans without healthcare, including millions of conservatives in red states.Donald Trump is an asshole. He wants to kill a major healthcare law just because it is known as Obamacare and because he is desperate for major legislation to sign. He hasn t even actually read the damn bill, which medical organizations and the healthcare industry agree is terrible.Besides, if Trump wanted McCain s vote so much he should have thought of that before criticizing him for being a POW.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News
 Trump Whines That The Media Wouldnâ€™t Film His Crowd In Alabama â€“ CNN Makes A Fool Out Of Him,"Trump s desperation to convince people that the Great Liberal Media Conspiracy Against Him is real is getting way out of control. On Twitter earlier, he cried that nobody was asking about the media s totally biased coverage of Hillary during the election. He also claimed at a rally a while back that the press was turning their cameras off during his speech because they didn t want their audiences to hear what he had to say. CNN made him look stupid for that. Then tonight, in Alabama, he did it again, and CNN made him look even worse for it.He said,  Fake news. They won t show this,  referring to his obsession with his crowd sizes. He then went on to say: They ll say  Donald Trump spoke before a small crowd in Alabama last night. It was a small crowd. A very unenthusiastic crowd. It was a terrible evening. CNN had split the screen between him and his crowd before he started this diatribe. Seriously   he said this while CNN was showing his crowd.

" Republican Senator STUNS In Town Hall, Admits GOPâ€™s ObamaCare Repeal Will Fail (TWEETS)","There s a lot of buzz about the GOP s latest effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare. As the GOP plans to vote on the Graham-Cassidy health care bill, their previous failures are coming back to haunt them, as many people are wondering why the Republican Party even continues to try to push a health care agenda that has repeatedly failed and isn t even wanted by the majority of Americans.The GOP s fight to repeal ObamaCare has never looked as pathetic as it did today when Republican Sen. Joni Ernst admitted that this bill is as good as dead during a town hall in Iowa. In speaking about the Graham-Cassidy bill, Ernst said to much applause: I ll be honest, it seems unlikely that we ll be voting on this.  Seriously, this is a major blow to the GOP. Not only are Republican senators publicly expressing doubt over this health care bill, but some top Republicans   like Arizona Senator John McCain   are actively going to vote against it.As it stands, most of America   Republicans included   want bipartisan fixes to the Affordable Care Act. The majority of the country overwhelmingly is in favor of keeping ObamaCare, but the GOP continues to ignore what the people want. Instead, they are hellbent on stripping millions of healthcare and hiking up premiums.The insane thing is that even if Graham-Cassidy fails (which it likely will), the GOP will probably just continue to draft more health care bills! They seem to learn nothing from their failures and see nothing wrong with wasting time and energy that could be used for something far more promising. Under Trump s  leadership , the Republican Party has never been so ineffective   obviously taking after their leader s example. No one believes in the GOP s ability to improve health care   not even its own Senators.Featured image is a screenshot",News

Just a few days ago, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer made an appearance at the Emmys to mock his old boss, and now former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci has made a television appearance as well. Basically, Trump should be terrified if this keeps happening.Anthony Scaramucci s short-lived role in the White House was pure insanity for the entirety of its 11 days. From day one, he became polarizing and controversial, causing several actors to rush at the opportunity to imitate him   including comedian Mario Cantone, who became known for his perfect impersonation of  the Mooch.  Little did Scaramucci know, his memorable time as Communications Director would come back to bite him in the a**.On Friday, Scaramucci appeared on The View, where he was suddenly confronted with a surprise appearance by Cantone, who called Scaramucci his doppelg nger.  Cantone sat right next to Scaramucci and said: Look at this guy! He s my doppelg nger! Scaramucci was more than uncomfortable and tried to get Cantone to stop imitating him by asking semi-serious questions. Scaramucci asked: How bummed were you when I was fired? You were on your way. And then you got shot like a little bird and hit the water. You had to be bummed. Unfortunately for the Mooch, Cantone continued to imitate him and landed this epic diss: You re lucky you re here. You got nothing. Spicer got the EMMYs. You re sitting here with four bleeding heart chiacchierones. Scaramucci tried to be a good sport for the rest of the show, but he was visibly irked by Cantone s portrayal of him as he spoke about his time as Communications Director.You can watch Scaramucci hate every second of this surprise appearance below:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News
 Michelle Obama Opens A Can Of Whoop A** On Trump Without Ever Mentioning His Name,"Without even mentioning Donald Trump s name former First Lady Michelle Obama opened a can of whoop ass on his administration Thursday, saying that the White House is currently being led by fear. Mrs Obama was speaking at a tech conference in Utah, and said that her husband s presidency was built on hope, while Trump s is being led with fear, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. It isn t just us first,  she said, referring to Trump s  America first  agenda.  We live in a big country and a big world,  she said.  You can t just want to help someone in a hurricane and not make sure they can go to the doctor when they re sick. At the United Nations, Trump again reiterated his America First policies. As president of the United States, I will always put America first, just like you as the leaders of your countries will always and should always put your countries first,  he said.Mrs. Obama said that  things are tough right now  and suggested that  we re being tested  but added that she  continues to be hopeful  that the political climate will improve.An audience member urged the former First Lady to run for president in 2020, but she said,  Oh, no!   Running for office is nowhere on the radar screen, but continuing in public service is something I will do for the rest of my life. Mrs. Obama isn t alone in her thinking of the current administration.According to a new Gallup poll, the majority of Americans think Trump lacks courage and is generally unprepared as a leader.Only 22 percent of Americans describe Trump as prepared; 25 percent said he s consistent; 28 percent said he s inspiring, and only 32 percent feel that the former reality show star is courageous.In contrast, 66 percent of Americans described President Barack Obama as a  strong and decisive  leader, and by 72 percent as a man  willing to make hard decisions  in a Gallup poll released at the same point in his first term, back in 2009.Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images.",News
" BREAKING: John McCain Breaks With His Best Senate Friend, Will Vote No On Graham-Cassidy Deathcare Bill (VIDEO)","Senator John McCain is battling an aggressive form of brain cancer that will likely kill him, and he knows this. This grave reality seems to have given him a new outlook on his role as a United States Senator. In fact, his lease on life is so new and refreshing that he is going up against his best Senate friend, Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC). Now that McCain is firmly in the  no  camp, the GOP can only lose one more vote, as Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) is already a hard  no  vote as well.This bill is even more radical than the one McCain killed before, with a drastic move on the Senate Floor as Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell looked on with his stony turtle face signaling humiliation and rage. On this bill, McCain says: I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal. Here is the full statement, via Twitter:BREAKING: Sen John McCain comes out in opposition to Graham-Cassidy: "" I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal"" pic.twitter.com/Xy50UPAZUo  Evan Rosenfeld (@Evan_Rosenfeld) September 22, 2017His original statement in an interview was less promising, but he voiced grave concerns already, so this is really no surprise.

 Medicaid Directors Of All 50 States Issue Joint Statement Slamming GOP Health Bill,"On Thursday, the National Association of Medicaid Directors sent Congress a devastating letter about their planned overhaul of American healthcare. The NAMD is an organization comprised of quite literally every single Medicaid chief in the country, and any statement issued by the entirety of its body is a rare thing. Ironically, the Trump era seems to have ushered in more than one situation in which there is unanimity in opposition to his policies and positions.Medicaid directors are appointed by state governors, which means that the office is filled by partisan picks. Fully 34 of the 50 states, in fact, have Republican governors, so the joint statement isn t just bipartisan   it s almost hyper-partisan.That makes this sharp criticism of the Graham-Cassidy bill even more poignant:BREAKING: The bipartisan Medicaid Directors from all 50 states just issued this negative statement about Graham-Cassidy.Big. Very unusual. pic.twitter.com/ZtqaAI8hg1  Andy Slavitt (@ASlavitt) September 22, 2017That tweet is clickable, and each image in the tweet is clickable, but here are the important parts, in case you don t feel like popping over to Twitter. The bill makes some major changes to Medicaid funding, including a massive transfer of funds from  blue  states to  red  states, and a transition to  block grants  that do not account for increased membership in Medicaid programs. That is to say, states would get the same fixed amount of money no matter how many people signed up, making states with high membership among those with the lowest per-patient allowance. Taken together, the per-capita caps and the envisioned block grant would constitute the largest intergovernmental transfer of financial risk from the federal government to the states in our country s history. The scope of this work, and the resources required to support state planning and implementation activities, cannot be overstated. States will need to develop overall strategies, invest in infrastructure development, systems changes, provider and managed care plan contracting, and perform a host of other activities. The vast majority of states will not be able to do so within the two-year timeframe envisioned here, especially considering the apparent lack of federal funding in the bill to support these critical activities. With only a few legislative days left for the entire process to conclude, there clearly is not sufficient time for policymakers, Governors, Medicaid Directors, or other critical stakeholders to engage in the thoughtful deliberation necessary to ensure successful long-term reforms. The mostly-Republican board of Medicaid Directors also took the GOP to task for trying to pass this bill before getting a score from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. Usually, that s the minimum a bill must have to even be considered for a vote. But Republicans are attempting to pass this bill before the end of the month, since that s the cutoff for them to do so with a simple majority. The Senate parliamentarian ruled that budget reconciliation, the process by which bills can be passed with a simple majority, expires at the end of Fiscal Year 2017. After September, votes will once again be subject to filibusters, meaning Republicans will need to muster 60 votes for anything they want to pass, unless they take Donald Trump s advice and invoke the  nuclear option  in the Senate.That s unlikely to happen, and Republicans are more desperate than ever for a win in Congress. That makes Graham-Cassidy a real danger to the future of American healthcare, despite this damning letter from the NAMD, and despite the massive opposition to the bill by every medical association, most states, nearly all consumers, and even some Republicans.Buckle up, my friends. This could get ugly.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News
 Trumpâ€™s HHS Sec. Latest To Be Caught Spending HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS Of Tax Dollars On Luxuries,"What is it with the Trump administration and spending tax dollars on things that are literal luxuries? Tom Price, Secretary of Health and Human Services, just got busted spending taxpayer dollars traveling on private planes   something to the tune of $300,000 already. Private travel on the taxpayers  dime is apparently the norm for Price   he s been doing this since he took the helm over at HHS.According to a report from Politico, Kathleen Sebelius and Sylvia Burwell, both of whom headed up HHS under Obama, tended to travel on commercial airlines when flying domestically. Price s officials claim that he only uses private jets when commercial travel isn t feasible, but most of these flights are between big U.S. cities where many airlines regularly fly. For instance, he took a private jet from Washington, D.C., to Nashville, but there are four nonstop flights per day between those two cities, with fares as low as $202.Even if he insisted on flying first class, that flight would have been considerably cheaper with average ticket prices around $1,000. His private jet from D.C. to Nashville cost $17,760.Most of his flights are to areas where he speaks about the opioid epidemic, and these engagements are planned well in advance so he could book his flights well in advance, too. It s not like most of his travel is at the last minute due to the nature of his job, or his  demanding schedule,  which is another excuse HHS officials are using.His spokespeople also claimed that he was taking private jets because he was just so amazingly busy directing recovery efforts in the hurricane-ravaged areas of Texas and Florida. However, Politico says that at least 17 of these private flights happened before Hurricane Harvey. There s no way he could possibly have been needed for recovery efforts for a hurricane that hadn t happened yet.One of those flights was from San Diego to the Aspen Ideas Festival in June. That s a swanky festival in the swanky resort town of Aspen, CO, and he spent taxpayer dollars on that. While it s true that he was speaking during a panel there, he arrived 19 hours before that panel, so it s really hard for him to claim that he had to book a private jet because this was too last minute. An average of 26 percent of the flights that go into Aspen are scheduled commercial   it s not like it s impossible to fly commercial into Aspen-Pitkin. Price s plane could have cost us as much as $7,100. Commercial flights cost well under half that.This administration is all about wasting taxpayer dollars, but cutting needed spending, while pretending to stand for regular Americans. It s absolutely sickening.Featured image via Chris Kleponis   Pool/Getty Images",News
" Trump Regrets, Move Over: â€˜Sassy Gay Republicanâ€™ Is All Of The Healthcare Angst We Need Right Now","Unless you ve been living under a rock since January, you know that Republicans across the country have been slowly but slowly waking up to the horror that is their giant November mistake. In tale after tale, unfortunate conservatives, once defiant in their hatred of all things left of Hannity, are beginning to see what dyed-in-the-wool Republican policy looks like, and it ain t pretty.But with the disgusting Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill just around the corner and racing toward its September 30th finish line, Trumpcare is everything that MAGA-wearing troglodytes feared: They are just finding out that their diabetes will no longer be covered, their kid s heroin addiction is an afterthought, and their ailin  mama s Medicare is fixin  to be plowed over.Those folks I actually feel kind of bad for. I mean, not really. Most of them voted Trump because they hate Mexicans and gay people. But at least they have the decency to be sick over how nasty it s going to be to get sick under Trumpcare.The ones I have no sympathy for are the self-proclaimed  intellectuals  in the conservative realm. Like one  Sassy Gay Republican  on Twitter. His name is Alex, and if you visit his Twitter right now, it s a bit of a mess, because he s busy soaking in the fame and glory that comes with a BuzzFeed interview and someone calling you  the next Tomi Lahren  (which I don t think Alex has really thought through).But Bill Armagh felt kinda bad for Sassy Alex when he saw that he d been involved in a terrible car accident.

Go on, Sassy:But then Sassy hits a snag in the pantyhose of life, and is forced to re-think some things:That can t be good. If only there was a way you could be covered in situations like this. Hmm And even Billy was surprised to find out there was more to the story of the Sassy Gay Republican. It turns out his conservative friends didn t have as much sympathy for him as he thought they might in his time of need:And it looks like Sassy himself may be having some serious second thoughts about how well conservative policies serve his interests:Welcome to the club, Sassy Gay Republican.

 Muellerâ€™s Latest Request In Russia Investigation Is Going To DESTROY Trump (DETAILS),"Special Counsel Robert Mueller has just dropped yet another unpleasant bombshell on Donald Trump, and it s really going to screw our disgraceful POTUS over.In the latest development in Trump s Russia investigation, Mueller is requesting the phone records from an Air Force One meeting where Trump apparently personally dictated the misleading statement about a meeting involving members of his campaign and a Russian official.Politico reports that records that Mueller is requesting will give insight into the statement that Trump s son, Donald Trump Jr., gave   a statement that caused Trump a massive amount of trouble when it was exposed. Sources close to the investigation have also stated that Mueller is investigating whether or not Trump is guilty for obstruction of justice when it comes to the firing of former FBI Director James Comey.To make matters even worse for Trump, Mueller also wants the documents that were related to a press briefing in May, in which former White House press secretary Sean Spicer had stated that Trump had confidence in Comey   and yet he fired the then-FBI Director less than a week later.If this doesn t look like the walls are caving in on Trump, we don t know what does. Mueller is getting closer to uncovering everything that Trump has been hiding, and it doesn t look like it s going to end well for the undeserving POTUS and his equally crooked campaign. What we can expect in the meantime is some very predictable, erratic behavior from Trump   threats to North Korea, unpresidential attacks on the media, more Obama and Clinton jabs   basically anything to distract America from his Russia probe. But Trump can only do that for so long   and it s clearly starting to catch up with him. It s only a matter of time before Mueller catches him red handed.Featured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images",News
 Beef Jerky Company Just Bit Off More Than It Can Chew With Direct Appeal To Nazis (VIDEO),"Jack Links, which is a very popular maker of beef jerky, just released a brand-new ad that is absolutely disgusting. It s supposed to give you facts about building muscle, and how beef jerky can aid you in that endeavor, but it does so as a direct appeal to Nazis and other white supremacists. Seriously.The 30-second spot features Green Bay Packers linebacker Clay Matthews, who literally says the following, word for word, at the beginning of the ad: I m the product of hard work, superior genetics, Norse mythology, and protein. The ad also shows primates putting muscle fibers back together, which could be seen as promoting slavery and anti-Semitism, since racists and anti-Semites have traditionally used monkeys to disparage black people and Jews. Watch below: Superior genetics  is what white supremacy and anti-Semitism are all about. Sure, on their planet, people are people, but whites have superior genes and built the whole world, and everyone needs to understand that. Adolf Hitler s Aryan race was all about superior genetics, the white supremacists and Nazis in this country push that, so there s no getting away from the fact that the term is a dog whistle to white supremacy.What about the  Norse mythology  claim, though? Most of our Nazis and white supremacists want to preserve western European genetics. Norse mythology is Scandinavian, so what the hell? It turns out that this is also an appeal to a very racist brand of Odinism, which, unfortunately, does have a fairly strong history in the U.S. among the white supremacist hate groups.This brand of Odinism was popular in Nazi Germany, and it s popular among today s white supremacists, including Nazis, KKK members, skinheads, and others. The reason for that is  it sings the virtues of the tribe, or folk, strongly emphasizing genetic closeness. And it credits whites with building civilization and an ethic of individual responsibility,  according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. That s exactly what white supremacists want. No more mixing of races because that s  white genocide,  and an acceptance that whites are the superior race above all others.Odinism is likely more appealing to these people than Christianity because Christianity (attempts) to emphasize inclusion and love of all, not the racial division they want. It also fits better with the anti-Semitism these hate groups harbor than Christianity does. However, many in these hate groups still call themselves Christian and pervert Christianity to suit their own needs, which those who actually promote Christian ethics say is  a problem.  It s possible that particular conflict can drive white supremacists to Odinism.Jack Links has a serious problem on its hands with this ad. They just branded themselves as openly white supremacist with a desire to appeal to the worst elements of our society. One might try to claim that they re just ignorant of the current social and political environments, but that s about as likely as Trump not knowing who David Duke is.Featured image via video screen capture",News
 Anti-Porn GOP Florida Lawmaker Was Just Caught Porning On Twitter,"The GOP has a thing for porn. In 2016, Sen. Todd Weiler introduced legislation asking his state to recognize that porn is creating a public health hazard and Republicans thought that was a cool idea. Well, now it s 2017 and a Florida lawmaker who filed a similar proposal was just busted favoriting a porn tweet. You could say he got Ted Cruzed.Just a few days ago, State Rep. Ross Spano filed a bill to declare pornography a public health crisis in Florida, but from his Twitter account, it appears he  liked  a pornographic tweet.According to the Orlando Weekly, the Republican s list of likes on Twitter is typically football clips, Bible verses, and GOP-related content about how evil Islam is. But, nestled into his  likes  list is a tweet from Jan. 8 by the  Goddess Lesbian  Twitter account, which features a video clip from adult entertainment company Reality Kings. On that same day, Spano liked a Biblical quote-tweet from Franklin Graham but we re not sure if that was before or after he was watching lesbians having sexy-time in front of the camera.Screenshot!This wouldn t matter in the least except for the bill Spano filled, HR157, which the Orlando Weekly notes is  incredibly harsh on adult content  and he left that  liked  porn tweet up for nine months. It appears to be deleted now. Franklin Graham s liked tweet is still there, though.The bill, which is contrary to research, states that  recent research indicates that pornography is potentially biologically addictive, resulting in the user consuming increasingly more shocking material to satisfy the addiction,  and adds,  Pornography has a detrimental effect on families and is linked to a reluctance to enter into marriage, dissatisfaction in marriage and marital infidelity. Spano says he didn t do it. It wasn t him being horny on Twitter.Obviously, I have a long social media history on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram since I was first elected in 2012. With a thorough examination of my accounts, it will be easy to see that this is not my doing. I have since gone back, once notified, and rectified the problem. And I m now looking into how it occurred in the first place.In addition, referencing my prior statement, I don t believe any of this takes the focus off of the fact that there is a direct correlation between pornography and a host of societal problems, including human trafficking, exploitation of children, sex slavery, and domestic violence.Sure, it wasn t Spano, it must have been that other Spano guy with the same Twitter account and password. Sounds legit!Image via YouTube screen capture.",News
 Ann Coulter Calls For Assembling â€˜Death Squadsâ€™ To Kill Undocumented Immigrants (AUDIO),"This is why the right-wing should never have power again.Donald Trump s decision to work with Democrats on legislation that would enshrine the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program into law has angered his anti-immigration supporters.Despite the fact that these children were brought to America through no fault of their own and the fact that America is the only only home they have ever known, right-wingers like Ann Coulter want them deported anyway. And she is so angry over Trump s decision that she is now calling for the creation of death squads to go around the country executing anyone who is an undocumented immigrant or pro-immigration. We have made as clear as you can possibly make it, we want less immigration,  Coulter said during an appearance on the  Todd Starnes show.  Stop dumping the third world on the country. If he continues down this path, well I guess there are three options,  she continued.  There s the organizing the death squads for the people who ruined America, because there will be no more hope. I guess the other possibility is to   well I don t think anyone would mind him being impeached. What s the faction opposing that? And then at least we ll get Mike Pence. But in terms of saving America, maybe a third party. Here s the audio via Right Wing Watch.This is a seriously frightening threat that the American people must reject immediately. Furthermore, federal law enforcement authorities should investigate Coulter. Her words could literally inspire some right-wing nut jobs to actually create these death squads, which would go around terrorizing the nation.Killing immigrants and creating death squads is something that would make Adolf Hitler proud. This is the kind of action that Nazis want in this country and Coulter needs to face serious consequences for even suggesting it as an option.  Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty",News
 Obama Just Made A VERY Powerful Statement About Trumpâ€™s Attempts To Repeal Obamacare (VIDEO),"President Barack Obama appeared today at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation s  Goalkeepers  event, an event aimed at effecting change on a global scale in the areas of world hunger, education access and quality, clean energy, healthcare, gender equality, clean water, climate action, and a host of other goals the Foundation wants to help us work toward.Many speakers were on hand for the event, including President Obama, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, will.i.am, Malala, Stephen Fry, and more, all with stories of empowerment and positive change and possibility. But in America s current climate of fear and unease about what will happen with health care in this country, it was President Obama s speech that was particularly emblematic of the struggle we face in determining the outcome of the American way of life when it comes to insurance, medical care, and ongoing health concerns.This is in stark contrast with what we see in everyday life in America, where we seemingly can t even agree on whether or not white supremacists are bad, or if it s okay to run over protesters. We are engaged in a fight for our very lives, and at least legislatively speaking, Obama knows how hard it looks from where we are.From the video you re about to watch: [W]hen I see those people trying to undo that hard-won progress, for the 50th or 60th time, with bills that would raise costs or reduce coverage, or roll back protections for older Americans or people with pre-existing conditions   the cancer survivor, the expecting mom, or the child with autism, or asthma, for whom coverage once again would be almost unattainable  it is aggravating.And all of this being done without any demonstrable economic, or actuarial, or plain common sense rationale   it frustrates. And it s certainly frustrating to have to mobilize every couple months to keep our leaders from inflicting real human suffering on our constituents. President Obama couldn t be more right. Although he is diplomatic here and does not call out Donald Trump and the Republicans by name, it is vital that we hold them to account. It is absolutely imperative that we make sure they cannot tear away at the fabric of our society and rip away at the moral cloth we ve woven in beginning the process of ensuring every American has access to health care.Watch the video here:Featured image via Yana Paskova/Getty Images",News
 WATCH: Morgan Freeman Uses His Brilliant Movie Scripting Skills To Explain Just How Dangerous The Russia Scandal Is,"So many people want to call the Special Counsel investigation into the Trump campaign s potential collusion with the Russian government to fix the 2016 presidential election  fake news.  They listen to every word out of Donald Trump s mouth, all the while being blind to his systematically dismantling our democratic institutions   and potentially our republic as we know it. However, there is a huge anti-Trump resistance movement going, and we aren t going to sit idly by while this dangerous man   potentially with the aid of the Russian government   destroys all we hold dear as a nation. Well, whether the government cares about this or not, plenty of ordinary   and not so ordinary   citizens do care. One such person is iconic actor Morgan Freeman.Freeman has joined with other concerned citizens to raise awareness about the seriousness of the Russia probe. In his trademark, unmistakable baritone, Freeman announces in a new video for the newly launched Committee to Investigate Russia: We have been attacked. We are at war. Also with this new and potentially powerful organization is actor Rob Reiner. In his most ominous and godly voice, Freeman continues in the Committee s launch video: My fellow Americans, during this past election, we came under attack by the Russian government. I ve called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened. Freeman couches the whole thing as if it were some wildly brilliant movie script   but in the end reminds us all that it s not, that this is indeed very real and that Trump and Russia are very dangerous. Therefore, we must act.Also involved in the project are anti-Trump GOPers who have more patriotism in their pinkie fingernails than the cowards in Congress could ever know such as radio host Charlie Sykes and Atlantic editor David Frum.This truly is a brilliant project. Perhaps Freeman s compelling voice and brilliant way of expressing this crisis will break the Trump fever before we all perish from it. We can hope, that s for sure.Watch this incredible video below:For generations, ppl have fought to protect democracy. Now it s our turn.

 Trump Judicial Nominee: Transgender Children Are Part Of â€˜Satanâ€™s Planâ€™ Of â€˜Destructionâ€™,"Donald Trump s nominee for a federal judgeship in Texas sounds like Michele Bachmann in his defense of conversion therapy, a discredited and dangerous practice. That practice, which claims to change a person s sexual orientation or gender identity or expression, has been rejected by every mainstream medical and mental health organization for decades. So naturally, Donald Trump s judicial pick, Jeff Mateer, the current first assistant attorney general of Texas, thinks it s a swell idea.At the time Mateer was serving as general counsel of the First Liberty Institute (have you noticed the  liberty  never means what they think it means?), he faced criticism from LGBT rights groups.Flashback: As the GOP nominee, Donald Trump said,  As your president, I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens from the violence and oppression of a hateful foreign ideology. Believe me. And then he chose a bigot as his vice-president and now a judicial nominee with his head up his a**.If Mateer is confirmed by the US Senate, he will serve on the US District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.CNN reports:In a May 2015 speech, titled  The Church and Homosexuality,  Mateer discussed a Colorado lawsuit in which the parents of a transgender girl sued her school for preventing her from using the bathroom of her choice. In Colorado, a public school has been sued because a first grader and I forget the sex, she s a girl who thinks she s a boy or a boy who thinks she s a girl, it s probably that, a boy who thinks she s a girl,  Mateer said in a video posted on Vimeo in 2015 And the school said,  Well, she s not using the girl s restroom.  And so she has now sued to have a right to go in. Now, I submit to you, a parent of three children who are now young adults, a first grader really knows what their sexual identity?  he said.  I mean it just really shows you how Satan s plan is working and the destruction that s going on. Trump, however, said in April that people should  use the bathroom they feel is appropriate.  Apparently, that s all changed now as he picks staunch and extreme conservatives to fill his administration and now, judicial posts.In that same May 2015 speech, Mateer said that the Supreme Court decision allowing same-sex marriage could lead to what he called  disgusting  new forms of matrimony. I submit to you that there ll be no line there,  he said.  Why couldn t four 4 people wanna get married? Why not one man and three women? Or three women and one man? I mean, it s disgusting. I ve learned words I didn t know. I mean, other than my assistants here, have you ever heard the word  throuple ?  Throuple  so that s three people coming together of different sexes, maybe mixed sexes,  he continued as if he couldn t stop himself.  Them coming together. There are people who marry themselves. Somebody wanted to marry a tree. People marrying their pets. It s just like   you know, you read the New Testament and you read about all the things and you think,  Oh, that s not going on in our community.  Oh yes, it is. We re back to that time where debauchery rules. Later that year in November 2015, Mateer blasted states for banning gay conversion therapy at a conference hosted by controversial pastor Kevin Swanson, who preaches that the Biblical punishment for homosexuality is death. Swanson has called for executing gays and he did that at an event packed with GOP candidates. The issue is always, it s same sex,  Mateer said, according to CNN.  And if you re giving conversion therapy, that s been outlawed in at least two states and then in some local areas. So they re invading that area. Image via screen capture. ",News
 Trump APOLOGIZED To Dictator After Protesters Attacked His Guardsâ€™ Fists With Their Faces,"Donald Trump has spent a lot of time cozying up to dictators during his time as what we are forced to call  President,  but he just did something that should have every single American outraged: he apologized to Turkish dictator Recep Tayyip Erdo an over an incident earlier this year in which his bodyguards brutally attacked American protesters.Eleven Americans were injured (including a police officer) and nine were hospitalized when Erdo an s security forces charged a group of peaceful protesters outside the Turkish ambassador s residence. We are communicating our concern to the Turkish government in the strongest possible terms,  State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said at the time.Apparently, that translates to:  I m sorry Daddy, please don t be mad at me. Can I still have a pony? Erdo an told PBS NewsHour on Tuesday that Donald Trump called  about a week ago about this issue.  And Trump certainly took a stand against Americans: He said that he was sorry and that he was going to follow up on this issue when we come to the United States within the framework for an official visit. The White House, which regularly lies in press conferences and releases, denies that an apology was made.Last month, a grand jury indicted 19 defendants (including 15 of Erdo an s security guards) for the brutal attack on protesters. The Hill reports:The defendants, 16 of whom were charged in June on criminal complaints, were indicted on a charge of conspiracy to commit a crime of violence. Many of the 19 were also indicted on additional charges including assault with a dangerous weapon and aggravated assault.The charges stem from Turkish President Recep Erdogan s visit to Washington in May to meet President Trump. Guards for Erdogan attacked protesters near the embassy in a brawl that was caught on video.The Turkish Embassy defended the guards at the time, saying they were acting in self-defense and claiming the protesters were aligned with a terrorist group from Turkey.But Washington s police chief said the attack was unprovoked.Two defendants have been arrested, but the rest are currently at large.Was Erdo an lying? Maybe   but at this point, he is more trustworthy than our serial liar-in-chief who regularly shows his disdain for the majority of the people he is supposed to lead.Donald Trump is disgusting, as is anyone who works for him willingly and anyone who voted for him.Featured image via screengrab",News
 Global Survey HUMILIATES Trump After He Claims World Leaders Loved Everything He Said At United Nations,"Let s just put it this way, if world leaders really agree with Donald Trump they have a lot of explaining to do in their home countries.Because a massive global survey found that only TWO nations think Trump is doing a good job.During his speech to the United Nations General Assembly this week, Trump voiced his disdain for the United Nations, accusing the organization of being a mismanaged bureaucracy and threatened to pull American financial and military support.Trump also threatened war with North Korea and criticized the Iran nuclear deal while one of his top advisers told climate ministers that Trump is still withdrawing America from the historic Paris climate agreement.Afterwards, Trump took to Twitter to boast about his speech, and claimed that those in attendance agreed with most or all of what he said.A great and important day at the United Nations.Met with leaders of many nations who agree with much (or all) of what I stated in my speech!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2017In fact, Trump received tepid clapping from the General Assembly, not even close to the kind of thunderous applause President Obama received when he spoke before the international peace-keeping body.And a new study of global surveys reveals that most nations in the world have very little confidence in Trump, which means all the world diplomats who supposedly agree with  much or all  of what Trump said can expect to be replaced. In fact, the only nations who have a favorable view of Trump are Russia and Israel.According to FiveThirtyEight.com, Since Trump took office, confidence in the president has gone down further, on average, than favorability toward the U.S.: Confidence dropped 47 points; U.S. favorability just 13 points Some of the biggest declines have been in countries with whom the U.S. has a collective defense agreement, such as NATO members and Japan, especially when it comes to confidence in the president Mexico, unsurprisingly, also saw a big public opinion drop on both questions. On the other hand, public favorability toward the U.S. has gone up in Russia, and public confidence in the president has gone up in both Israel and Russia since Trump took office. While President Obama enjoyed a public confidence rating of 63 to 73 percent, Trump only has a rating of 27 percent.One of the largest drops came from South Korea, in which only 17 percent have confidence in Trump. 88 percent had confidence in President Obama just two years ago. Clearly, South Koreans are alarmed by the pissing match Trump is having with Kim Jong-Un to discover who is the craziest dictator of them all. Overall, though, Trump has brought a return to George W. Bush-era levels of favorability for the U.S. and the presidency,  FiveThirtyEight concluded.And it turns out that the world disagrees with Trump on most of the issues.Only one nation agreed with Trump s climate change policy. Trump s Mexican border wall was  almost universally disliked.  His vows to withdraw from trade agreements were just as unpopular. Only Turkey approved of withdrawing from the Iran deal. And only three nations approve of Trump s Muslim ban. Basically, most of Trump s supporters come from nations that have committed human rights violations or have oppressive governments.In short, the world representatives who make up the United Nations General Assembly are more likely repulsed by Trump. Tepid clapping is not the definition of overwhelming agreement. Trump thinks that everyone likes him and agrees with him because he is a delusional narcissist.The reality is that Trump has turned America into an international joke and has harmed our reputation around the globe. He is an embarrassment to our country who should be removed from office immediately before he inflicts more damage.He is now the most hated president in history, and that must make George W. Bush very happy. Featured Image: Ron Sachs   Pool/Getty Images",News
" Trumpâ€™s UN Speech May Have Been Terrible, But The Faces Of Other Representatives Were Priceless","By now you would be more than aware of President Trump s first address to the United Nations General Assembly, a speech that CNN s senior White House correspondent Jim Acosta referred to as  a lot of Trump tweets strung together. Trump has never been shy in criticizing the UN, but now also needs their help and in his rambling, combative 41-minute speech, allegedly written by Stephen Miller, the President acted like school bully, calling terrorists  losers,  referring to Kim Jong Un as  Rocket Man  and threatening to  totally destroy North Korea if the US and its allies were forced to defend themselves.In fact, at times it almost seemed like an unfunny roast of sorts, looking around the room, randomly calling out world leaders and criticizing their leadership, as well as their countries; He called the Iranian government  a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy  whose  chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos  and described Venezuela under President Nicol s Maduro as a  corrupt regime  that has  destroyed a prosperous nation by ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried.  Strangely enough, Russia wasn t targeted in his act.President Trump seemed quite happy with his delivery, taking to Twitter to boast about the overwhelmingly positive reaction to his speech:A great and important day at the United Nations.Met with leaders of many nations who agree with much (or all) of what I stated in my speech!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2017But was it, though? Sure, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted that, in his 30 years with the UN, he had never heard a  bolder or more courageous speech,  however, few shared Netanyahu s sentiments. They say a picture paints a thousand words and here are some pictures that show the true responses of those in attendance as the President delivered his address:Photo: Eduardo Munoz / ReutersNorth Korean ambassador Ja Song Nam stormed out before the President had even begun speaking, which left both seats empty for the Democratic People s Republic of Korea.Photos: Mary Altaffer/APAll White House Chief of Staff John Kelly could do was put his head in his hands and wish he was anywhere else, while the first lady listened on expressionless, although maybe she s just not capable of facial expressions right now.Photo: UNTVWere the Zimbabwean representatives even listening? I guess it could be a pretty opportune chance to catch a power-nap.Photo: UNTVThis Syrian delegate seemed to be giving President Trump a not-so-subtle hand gesture.Photo: Mary Altaffer / APThe first thing you would probably notice about this Iranian representative is his less-than-pleased facial expression, but it turns out it was the fact that he donned his glasses while Trump blasted Tehran s  rogue regime  that showed his true feelings:In Persian culture putting on one's glasses is the equivalent of GTFOH https://t.co/36u6Fx4anM  Arash Karami (@thekarami) September 19, 2017Photo: UNTVBut the facial expressions of everyone shown here were almost certainly representative of almost all in attendance.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News
 Racist Charleston Church Shooter Seems To Think He Is Entitled To A Literal White Supremacist As His Public Defender,"By now, everyone knows that Dylann Roof, the South Carolina white supremacist who shot up am historic Black Church in Charleston South Carolina, did it because the parishioners were Black. They invited him to their worship service, and after he sat there with them for more than an hour, he killed them. Well, Roof has been sentenced to die, and his case is not in the appeals process. Like all people, no matter how despicable, Roof is entitled, via the law, to a competent defense. Since he cannot afford his own team of attorneys, they have been provided for him in the form of public defenders. There s just one problem with that, though: According to Dylann Roof, his lawyers are the wrong color.Appointed to represent Roof are public defenders Alexandra Yates and Sapna Mirchandani, who are Jewish and Indian, respectively. Those facts seem to be the only things that are wrong here, rather than their actual defense of Roof. This isn t the first time race has entered into Roof s court proceedings; he had similar mishaps with his original attorney during the trial portion of his ordeal. The man representing him during that time, David Bruck, is Jewish. Roof said of the issues there: His ethnicity was a constant source of conflict even with my constant efforts to look past it. Trust is a vital component in an attorney client relationship, and is important to the effectiveness of the defense. Because of my political views, which are arguably religious, it will be impossible for me to trust two attorneys that are my political and biological enemies. To that end, the racist murderer, who seems to be more or less representing himself at this point, penned a missive from prison, firing his public defenders on the basis of their ethnicity:As if all of this weren t bad enough, Roof threatened his original lawyer, David Bruck, with death if he ever got out of prison.Luckily, the judge presiding over Roof s case sees his racism for what it is, and is denying this so-called  motion. In short, if anyone deserves the death penalty, it s this piece of less-than-human excrement. No sympathy here, despite my usual opposition to the death penalty. If anyone deserves to die for his crimes, it s Dylann Roof.Featured image via video screen capture from ABC News Video",News
 Trump Just Became First President In Modern History To Use Campaign Funds For Criminal Defense,"Donald Trump has been fundraising like crazy for his re-election campaign, having filed his papers the day he was inaugurated for his first term. But there s quite possibly an odd reason for his incessant begging for funds: According to Reuters, he s using the money to pay for his defense team in the Russia scandal.Reuters spoke to two people who are familiar with the situation, but they were unable to determine how much has already been spent on legal fees. Federal election laws allow candidates to spend private campaign donations on legal matters, but up until now, the legal matters in question dealt with routine and mundane things such as compliance requirements and ballot access issues.Trump may well become the first president in the modern campaign finance era to use his donations to pay for a criminal defense in addition to routine legal matters. One of the biggest reasons that candidates shifted largely from public financing to private financing for their election campaigns is so they have greater flexibility in how they spend that money. That helps to give Trump greater latitude to spend donations on his own legal defense. Furthermore, since the Russia scandal is something that may not have existed had he not been elected, Trump and his family may well be legally free to spend their donors  dollars on Russia.His campaign organization currently has nearly $12 million. When Reuters asked Trump s lead attorney how the bills were getting paid, he snapped,  That s none of your business. Trump spent a large chunk of his campaign funding on his own properties during the 2016 election cycle, and has been spending government money at some of those same properties, lining his pockets with public dollars. His campaign has paid one law firm Jones Day almost $4 million, some of which probably did go to help with the Russia probe. Jones Day has also responded to inquiries related to Russia, including sending documents to Congress on the campaign s behalf.Here s the sad thing: His donors, whether they know where their money is going or not, would probably cheer their chance to help Trump defeat the liberal conspiracy that is the Russia probe. They think they re helping him get re-elected in 2020, so they think they re helping him defeat the great deep-state witch hunt.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News
 We Canâ€™t Afford To Feed The Poor But Weâ€™re Spending $700 Billion Per Year To Kill People,"The military s budget is being massively expanded this year, and nobody is really sure why. The answer seems to be  because we can.  Republicans in the Senate have decided that the Pentagon should receive even more money than Trump s hawkish White House wanted, and is giving the military things it never requested and does not need. The 2018 National Defense Authorization Act approves a budget of $696 billion, an annual increase of $80 billion. Meanwhile, Republicans are out to gut aid programs for low-income Americans.So why aren t  deficit hawks  like Paul Ryan questioning where this money will come from? We re ballooning the deficit to kill people, and for what, exactly? The Pentagon does not need the money. For example, the budget has allowed for 94 new F-35 Lightning fighter jets. Via Bloomberg:The measure would authorize 94 F-35 jets made by Lockheed Martin Corp., 24 more than requested by the president and seven more than the House agreed to in its version of the bill.Oh, by the way, the budget is also illegal. Why is that? Well, a law passed in 2011 only allows $549 billion in base-related expenses. The United States has 800 military bases and hundreds of thousands of soldiers occupying nations around the globe. The budget as it stands recommends $640 billion:Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) said during floor debate that his panel ignored the budget constraints set in law because responding to national security challenges requires more resources. The threats to our national security have not been more complex, severe, or daunting at any time in the past seven decades   and our job is to ensure we have a military capable of meeting those threats,  McCain said.  For too long, we have locked ourselves into making strategic decisions based on budget realities. It is time to start making budget decisions based on strategic realities. That s right. Republicans think we should make  budget decisions based on strategic realities,  completely ignoring military-related deficits, in order to pay for jets (and other stuff) the military never asked for and does not need.Or, maybe, the massive lobbying arm of the defense industry has more to do with it. They ve already spent tens of millions in 2017 alone to buy politicians and influence, and there s no slowing down.these two things are unrelated pic.twitter.com/3PGzZzrLj9  Adam H. Johnson (@adamjohnsonNYC) September 19, 2017What else could that money pay for? Great question. Common Dreams has a great perspective on the true cost of needless military spending:Put another way, with a $700 billion military budget, the U.S. would be spending more than three times as much as China on its military, and 10 times as much as Russia. According to [the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute], the U.S. already accounts for more than a third of all military spending.Yes, in the entire world. The United States, with about 1/25 of the world s population, is responsible for over 1/3 of the military spending worldwide. Who are we preparing to fight, exactly?Or with $80 billion a year, you could make public colleges and universities in the U.S. tuition-free. In fact, Sanders s proposal was only estimated to cost the federal government $47 billion per year.If the additional military spending over the next 10 years instead went to pay off student debt, it could come close to wiping it out entirely.Yet those kind of ideas, or universal healthcare coverage, are dismissed out-of-hand by Republicans. Maybe that s because the everyday people who would benefit most don t pay as well as insurance and military lobbyists. Maybe that s because most politicians, but especially Republicans, are more invested in personal careers and success than they are in their country.Eight members of the Senate voted against the bill: Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Bob Corker (R-TN), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Mike Lee (R-UT), Rand Paul (R-KY), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News
 Trump Doesnâ€™t Want You To Know About This Study That PROVES Refugees Contribute To Our Economy,"Trump administration officials who were under pressure from the White House scrapped a study which found that refugees had brought in more government revenue overall than they had cost in benefits, the New York Times reports. The Trump administration has been unable to rationalize its move to reduce the number of refugees allowed into the United States next year, so it rejected a study by the Department of Health and Human Services which concluded that refugees brought in $63 billion more in government revenues over the past ten years than they cost.The New York Times reports:The draft report, which was obtained by The New York Times, contradicts a central argument made by advocates of deep cuts in refugee totals as President Trump faces an Oct. 1 deadline to decide on an allowable number. The issue has sparked intense debate within his administration as opponents of the program, led by Mr. Trump s chief policy adviser, Stephen Miller, assert that continuing to welcome refugees is too costly and raises concerns about terrorism.Alt-Right leader Richard Spencer has claimed that he was a mentor of Stephen Miller s and said that his mentee is a white nationalist. Miller denied that affiliation with Spencer, but his actions prove that he s an extremist.The study concluded that refugees  contributed an estimated $269.1 billion in revenues to all levels of government  between 2005 and 2014 via the payment of federal, state and local taxes.  Overall, this report estimated that the net fiscal impact of refugees was positive over the 10-year period, at $63 billion. The White House claims that the study was politically motivated. This leak was delivered by someone with an ideological agenda, not someone looking at hard data,  a White House spokesman said.  The actual report pursuant to the presidential memorandum shows that refugees with few skills coming from war-torn countries take more government benefits from the Department of Health and Human Services than the average population, and are not a net benefit to the U.S. economy. According to two sources, Miller personally intervened to ensure that only the costs   and not any fiscal benefit   of the program were considered, so it appears that he intentionally left out a few major details.Trump has filled his administration with swamp-like creatures, including Steve Bannon, who once played a large role in the White House, and Stephen Miller who still occupies Trump s ear.Photo: Alex Wong via Getty images.",News
 Republican Senate Candidate Thinks If You Donâ€™t Believe In God You Deserve To Be Shot,"Republicans always like to push back on the idea that they are bigots. However, that s hard to believe, considering some of their racist and otherwise bigoted official policies. It becomes an even harder claim to believe when they have openly bigoted candidates. Case in point   Alabama Senate Candidate Roy Moore.Moore has been removed from the federal bench not once but twice, due to his allowing his bigotry to make him defy the United States Supreme Court. Now, Moore has decided that his next target of American citizens is those who do not believe in the Christian god. In a shocking statement, Moore says of non-believers: You wonder why we re having shootings, and killings here in 2017? Because we ve asked for it. We ve taken God out of everything. We ve taken prayer out of school, we ve taken prayer out of council meetings. This man is a deranged extremist. He gave a speech just last month where he blamed America s march away from religion in the public square for the nation s ills. Well, newsflash, Mr. Moore: America is not, never has been, and never will be a Christian nation. You and your fellow fascist Christ warriors are in for a rude awakening. The rest of us will not tolerate your continued verbal abuse of us, and nor will we tolerate your attempting to enshrine bigotry into law. Considering where you re from   super Christian Alabama   you ll likely win your Senate race. However, I am sure that there are cooler heads within the United States Senate   including other Republicans   who will find this language offensive and outrageous, as they should.You, sir, are a bigot and a charlatan who has no business holding public office of any kind.Featured image via Gary Tramontina/Getty Images",News
" Roy Moore Wants To Be Alabamaâ€™s Senator, But He Canâ€™t Stop Being A Giant Racist","The name sounds familiar, right? Here s why: He used to be Judge Roy Moore, that one guy from The Dukes of Hazzard. Roscoe, you get them Duke Boys in here now! No, wait.Oh, that s right   He was Chief Justice Roy Moore, of the Alabama Supreme Court. Remember the dude back in 2003 who refused to remove the monument of the Ten Commandments from the grounds of the courthouse? That s him. He s one of just a handful of judges who have ever been removed from office in this country by a judicial panel. Funny enough, he got re-elected to the position a decade later, but got smacked down again, this time because he told Alabama judges to ignore the Supreme Court and continue turning away same-sex marriage license applicants.Now Ol  Roy wants to serve in the Yoo-nited States Senate, taking the place of Trump s Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who vacated his Senate seat after his appointment to the Department of Justice.The problem is, like the guy before him (who shares a namesake with that guy in the white hat), Roy Moore is an unrepentant racist. I m pretty sure when Roy kicks the proverbial bucket, his headstone is going to read  Jesus Christ Was A White Man. So it was with no small amount of suppressed horror that the world watched the Formerly-Honorable Roy Moore call Native Americans and Asians  reds and yellows  at a campaign event on Sunday: We know that we were torn apart in the Civil War. Brother against brother, North against South, party against party. What s changed? Now we got blacks and whites fighting. Reds and yellows fighting. Democrats and Republicans fighting. Men and women fighting. What s gonna unite us? What s gonna bring us back together? A president? A Congress? No, it s gonna be God. We assume he means the white, Republican, male God.Watch the video here:Featured image via Erik S. Lesser/Getty Images",News
 California Assembly Passes MAJOR Legislation To Keep Trump Off The Ballot In 2020,"You know how Donald Trump stubbornly refuses to release his tax returns? Well, the California state assembly told him to f*ck off last week when they passed a bill that would require presidential candidates to release their tax returns before they are allowed on the state s ballot.The Presidential Tax Transparency and Accountability Act passed 42-18 in the assembly and now heads to the state Senate. If and when it passes there, it will head to the governor s desk for his signature. President Trump s blatant disregard for the tradition of releasing tax returns is dangerous to our democracy,  says state Sen. Mike McGuire, one of the bill s co-authors. For decades, every President has put their personal beliefs aside and put our country first and released their returns. SB 149 helps to reestablish desperately needed transparency in the White House, and we are looking forward to seeing the Governor s signature on the bill,  he says of the bill, which would require at least five years of returns from candidates. As the months continue to go by in the disastrous Trump Administration and the investigations and conflicts of interest pile up, it becomes more and more clear how critical basic transparency is in how we elect our president,  another co-author of the bill, state senator Scott Wiener, said, adding that this would give  the American people the honesty and transparency they deserve. It s unlikely that Trump would win California in the first place, but it s looking like if he wants to do it in California he will need to cough up his returns.Featured image via Getty Images/Alex Wong",News
 CNNâ€™s Don Lemon: Trump Shouldnâ€™t Get Apology From ESPN Until He Apologizes For Racism Against Obama (VIDEO),"If Donald Trump really wants an apology from ESPN, he ll need to issue a significant public apology to President Obama first.At least that s what CNN host Don Lemon told TMZ when he was encountered by a crew at an airport this week.Last week, ESPN host Jemele Hill called Trump a white supremacist on Twitter in response to his remarks blaming  both sides  for the violence at Charlottesville and his comment that white supremacists are  fine people. Donald Trump is a white supremacist who has largely surrounded himself w/ other white supremacists,  Hill wrote.And it s true. Trump has been very reluctant to criticize white supremacists and does so very weakly when he finally does. And even then he soon reverses himself.Well, it didn t take long for Trump s team of snowflakes to cry foul. White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders abused her position by calling for ESPN to fire Hill.Then Trump attacked ESPN and demanded an apology on Twitter.ESPN is paying a really big price for its politics (and bad programming). People are dumping it in RECORD numbers. Apologize for untruth!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2017So far, Trump has not received an apology from ESPN or Hill. Instead, Hill expressed regret that her personal remarks on her personal Twitter account caused grief for her employers. She stood by her remarks about Trump.And according to Don Lemon, if Trump really wants an apology he should start by apologizing to President Obama for promoting birtherism. I think when the president worked for NBC at The Apprentice, and he said that Barack Obama was not born here, and he called Barack Obama a racist. If he apologizes for that, then maybe ESPN should apologize. Here s the video via YouTube.Frankly, Trump doesn t deserve an apology at all. But he definitely owes President Obama several apologies. Trump has repeatedly smeared Obama over the years, especially since taking office even though it s considered seriously bad taste to bash your predecessor in the way Trump has been doing.But Trump worst offense committed against Obama is the perpetuation of the racist birther claims that he repeatedly pushed, especially on Fox News.Trump should have to apologize for that, but he won t because he thinks he s the only one who is ever owed an apology. Trump plays the victim card all the time, but you never heard President Obama whine like Trump does because Obama has true class. Obama rose above the abuse while Trump throws temper tantrums like a petulant child over the smallest of slights.The difference between Hill and Trump is Hill called it like it is while Trump pushed damnable lies that had already been repeatedly debunked.He should be ashamed of himself.Featured Image: Zach Gibson   Pool/Getty Images",News

Well, that was last year. It s 2017 and the disgraced former Trump administration national security adviser is begging for donations to help with expenses to defray costs connected to the investigations into Russian election meddling.

 WATCH: Trump Brags About Himself And Trump Tower During Remarks At United Nations Headquarters,"It took all of a few seconds for Donald Trump to start bragging about himself during his remarks at the United Nations.Trump World Tower is a residential skyscraper catering primarily to the wealthy.It also happens to be across the street from the United Nations Headquarters where the General Assembly is meeting this week and where Trump spoke on Monday morning.Predictably, Trump began his remarks by bragging about the building and himself. Thank you very much. Thank you. I actually saw great potential right across the street to be honest with you,  Trump began.  And it was only for the reason that the United Nations was here that that turned out to be such a successful project. So, I want to thank you, Ambassador Haley for your introduction and your steadfast advocacy for American interests on the world stage. Here s the video via Twitter.Pres. Trump on luxury residential property by UN: United Nations being there was reason  that turned out to be such a successful project.  pic.twitter.com/kid9STah3W  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 18, 2017So, Trump can t even stop being a narcissist for one day to address the distinguished diplomats and representatives of the United Nations.It should be noted that New Yorkers strongly opposed the construction of Trump World Tower in the late 1990s, including legendary journalist Walter Cronkite.Basically, Trump robbed the neighborhood of their view of the East River and Long Island by placing a big ugly tower in front of it so that only wealthy people staying in his building could enjoy it. Residents were also concerned that the big ugly building would dwarf the more aesthetically pleasing United Nations Headquarters, which it did.Trump is nothing more than a cheap salesman who is more interested in touting his real estate ventures than he is in promoting international peace and cooperation. That s incredibly sad.Once again, Trump embarrassed himself and America on the world stage. And those were just his opening remarks. Just imagine how much more he will embarrass our country before he is done speaking. The United States is going to be an even bigger joke on the international stage than we have ever been.Featured Image: Screenshot",News
 Your Local News Station Might Be Turning Into A Pro-Trump Propaganda Network Right Before Your Eyes,"When Americans think about state-run television, we don t expect it to happen here. When we turn on the local news at night, we expect straight news, a rundown of the facts regarding local and national events. If we want opinion shows, we know where to go. If you re a conservative, there s a plethora of shows to watch on Fox News that offer soothing confirmation bias, such as Tucker Carlson Tonight, Hannity, or Fox and Friends. If you re a liberal, you can get the same on your side of the aisle on MSNBC with The Last Word with Lawrence O Donnell, The Rachel Maddow Show, or All In with Chris Hayes (though, to be fair, while they are opinion shows, the latter network doesn t lie, while Fox does). However, all of that could be changing.It turns out that many of America s local stations are owned by a company called Sinclair Broadcasting. That company happens to be pro-Trump. They are now going to have 174 stations around the country that will now be airing pro-Trump items on a daily basis, and those shows will be broadcast to the unsuspecting viewing public as actual news. According to Politicus USA, those shows will consist of the following:  The Terrorism Alert Desk, advertised as a daily news update about terrorist activity.  News pieces from Epshteyn, Sinclair s chief political analyst.  A clearly labeled opinion show featuring Mark Hyman, a former vice president of the company.This is especially dangerous, because Americans do not expect to be forced to watch propaganda mixed in with their news. They just want the truth, or shows that are clear opinion. That is not what this is, though. This is nothing more than the kind of stuff Kim Jung Un s regime is feeding his people in order to brainwash them. This is the kind of thing we see in authoritarian states, and it is incredibly dangerous for democracy.People keep saying not to compare Trump to a dictator, but it is becoming more and more clear that this is exactly what he is aiming to be   and he has plenty of help from his blind followers in high places.In short, beware, folks, because you re about to get a big dose of America s very own state-run propaganda.Featured image via William Thomas Cain/Getty Images",News
 Republicans Humiliated As John McCain Slams Their Latest Attempt To Repeal Obamacare (VIDEO),"The Republican Party still hasn t learned that their wildly unpopular repeal of Obamacare just isn t going to happen. Even after failing miserably the first several times they tried to get their alternative to the historic health care bill passed, they are still willing to get pummeled again.One of the senators who has been extremely outspoken against the GOP s alternatives is speaking out again   and it s a member of their own party.

McCain actually took the side of Trump and nailed the Republican Party for continuing to do its own thing: I m interested in that, of course. We  this President is always full of surprises.

What it should take place is the three of them, both leaders Republican and Democrat and the President sit down and say, okay, we got a problem here. We need to fix it. And that means that we can come up with all three of us in one solid proposal. Why did  why did Obamacare fail? Obamacare was ram through with Democrats votes only. Are we going to ram through our proposal with  with Democrats and the President? That s not the way to do it. We got to go back, if I could just say again, the way to do this is have a bill, put it through the committee. We have Patty Murray and Lamar Alexander doing fine, bring it to the floor. Have debate, have amendments, we passed our bill twenty-seven to nothing for the Armed Services Committee. McCain is firmly stating that he will not support a healthcare bill that the GOP is imply trying to shove down everyone s throats without following any sort of legislative protocol.This is bad   the Republicans are rushing to get this healthcare bill passed so they can strip millions of Americans of their health insurance, and they are doing it without the endorsement of the president or some of their most prominent members. This will only continue to be a massive embarrassment for conservatives. You can watch McCain rip the GOP below:Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News
 Itâ€™s Time To Stop Excusing Trump Supporters And Start Shaming Them For The Awful People They Are,"For nigh on two years now, people have been making the argument that not all Trump voters are racist, misogynistic bigots. This could be true; after all, there are people who voted for Barack Obama twice, but then switched to Donald Trump. The idea of this makes most of us scratch our heads because Obama was everything Trump isn t. President Obama is dignified, classy, smart, experienced, accepting of all people. Trump is bigoted to his core, narcissistic, incompetent, impulsive, undignified, unpresidential. Therefore, how could people who voted enthusiastically for Barack Obama vote for Donald Trump? I still don t know the answer to that question. What I do know is this: It s time to stop making excuses for Trump voters and start shaming them, because that is what they deserve.Even if someone who voted for Donald Trump isn t personally a racist, a misogynist, a homophobe, or an Islamophobe, they certainly are tolerant of those various bigotries and then some. They were able to look at the Access Hollywood tape, Trump s call to ban all Muslims from the nation, his kicking off his campaign by calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, his promise (and current attempts to carry out that promise) to round up hundreds of thousands of people and kick them out of the nation, his five-year-long crusade to delegitimize the first Black president   all of it   and still vote for him. They were able to realize just what a Trump Administration and all of its disgusting white supremacist glory would do to every American who is not a straight, white, Christian man and still pull the lever for him. These voters are selfish people who took an unconscionably callous position when it comes to the fate of millions of Americans. They knew he d do things like stacking the courts   lifetime appointments, by the way   with conspiracy theorists, racists, misogynists, and birthers, and they still voted for Trump.I could go on, but you get the picture.Trump voters watched the same campaign the rest of us did, and they saw the abhorrent behavior, the unending stream of bigotry, the dangerous flirtation with authoritarian figures around the world, the clear unfitness, and they voted for him anyway. These are not good people. It s time to stop making excuses for the people who voted for the most bigoted, ignorant, dangerous president in modern history. We have literal Nazis working in the White House because of these people. We have, in Jeff Sessions, a man who was deemed too racist in 1986 to be a federal judge as Attorney General. We have birthers on the federal bench. That s all their fault.There are no good people who are Trump voters. It s time we recognized a hard truth: There s no such thing as a good person who supports Donald Trump. Stop excusing them and start shaming them. It s up to us to recognize the ills in the American populous   starting with the absolute imbeciles who voted for Donald Trump.Featured image via Daily Kos",News

" Pastor Decides Straight Couple Canâ€™t Even SUPPORT Marriage Equality, Cancels Their Wedding","I m shooting for irony here, so bear with me: Thank GOD some people proclaim their bigotry out loud, so you don t have to find out the hard way.Okay, so this couple (who are choosing to remain anonymous) kind of did find out the hard way, but they re still free to make other arrangements after the minister of their church called them into a private meeting to let them know he would no longer perform their ceremony or allow them to marry in his church.Pictured: IronyThe problem, according to Minister Steven North of Ebenezer St. John s Presbyterian Church, was the bride s recent comment on Facebook in support of marriage equality in her native Australia. The country is holding a survey   because some places value the individual input of their citizens   to help the Australian parliament decide whether or not to allow same-sex couples to marry.Apparently, the clergyman was monitoring the bride-to-be s social media, where she spoke up in support of the measure: I know it s something not everyone will agree on and that s fine but this is what I stand for and frankly it doesn t effect [sic] my relationship with [my partner] one bit. That s when North made the decision to summon the couple into his office. Not only did he tell them that he would not perform the ceremony, but he drove the point home with a letter to the couple as well: After the pre-marital counselling that you attended and the sermons delivered at Ebenezer on this subject, you must surely appreciate that your commitment to same-sex marriage opposes the teaching of Christ Jesus and the scriptural position practiced by the Presbyterian Church of Australia and by me. This conflict of views has practical consequences in relation to your upcoming wedding. If I remember correctly   and believe me, as someone who was raised in a very religious household, I do   Jesus said as much about same-sex weddings as He did about abortions or whether His Dad wants you to drink that miracle water that creepy Peter Popoff sells at 2 AM on cable. That is to say, nothing. There were no  teachings of Christ Jesus  on gay marriage. So really the operative part of North s statement is that whole thing at the end where he says  and by me. The bride was having none of it. The couple has decided to leave their long-time church, and they did so with a statement of their own: We feel this decision is absolutely disgraceful and is a disgrace to you and all the church, especially when we have been loyal and valued members of this congregation for 10 years. You were made aware from the beginning of our proceedings that we had gay friends and also that people in our wedding party were gay. How could you assume that we would abandon them or degrade them with regards to same-sex marriage? Rather than acquiesce to the thought police of her bigoted church, this couple has faith that they re doing the right thing.Featured image via Scott Barbour/Getty Images",News
 GOP Implodes As California Passes Bill To Make Congress Censure Trumpâ€™s Racism (DETAILS),"About a month ago, Donald Trump shocked the country by responding to a violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville in a way that was completely vile. Defending white supremacists and stating that  both sides  were responsible for the violence, Americans across the country were horrified that such a racist message could come from the President of the United States. And now, some areas of the country are standing up to it.California is now sending a strong message to Trump and his administration in response to the horrific endorsements Trump has given to white supremacists. The lower house of the California legislature has just passed a resolution that is demanding that Congress censure Trump so that the undeserving POTUS is clear that We will no longer tolerate his behavior. Assembly member Tony Thurmond said: The leader of the free world can t continue to use language that legitimizes the actions of extremists groups that promote hate. Congress must exercise its power to check the president by voting for his immediate censure. While a GOP-dominant Congress likely won t censure Trump, this initiative marks the first attempt to censure a sitting President since 1834   and that should send a strong message. The Hill also reports that California is trying to get other states to join them in similar ways, demanding that Trump should  publicly apologize to all Americans for his racist and bigoted behavior. This bill follows Trump s own resolution in which he tried to condemn the attacks in Charlottesville. However, he continues to fall short with his weak statements. Refusing to denounce the specific hate groups that are responsible, Trump instead spoke against racism in all forms.  Here s Trump s weak, spineless statement: We condemn the recent violence in Charlottesville and oppose hatred, bigotry, and racism in all forms. Hours before, Trump had doubled down on his horrendous  both sides  comment, stating that counterprotesters were also to blame: You have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also. When you look at really what s happened since Charlottesville, a lot of people are saying and people have actually written,  Gee Trump may have a point. That is seriously disgusting. For that statement alone, Trump deserves the treatment he s getting from California.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News
 Trump Supporters At â€˜Mother Of All Ralliesâ€™ MASSIVELY Outnumbered By Marching Juggalos,"Saturday, September 16th, 2017 will surely go down as the strangest day for rallies in our nation s capital since at least January, when millions of invisible people attended Donald Trump s inauguration ceremony.Two different gatherings are taking place, quartered in different sections of the National Mall, but surely visible to one another: Trump supporters have come together to put on what they re calling the  Mother of all Rallies,  with expected attendance undoubtedly in the zillions, and a rally with an actual purpose is also taking place. Juggalos, or fans of the band Insane Clown Posse, are in D.C. to protest what they call an unfair label from the FBI and Department of Justice classifying them as a  loosely organized hybrid gang. It s clear which group has the more ardent supporters, and it isn t the one I m calling (for the purposes of this piece)  the Trumpettes. Donald Trump is known for his loyalty demands, but I m not sure he s ever met a Juggalo, because they showed up today:WASHINGTON, DC   SEPTEMBER 16: People gather for a rally during the Juggalo March at the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall, September 16, 2017 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)That s the Juggalos showing up. The Juggalo March, at the time of this writing, is just getting underway.This, on the other hand, is the majority of the Trump rally happening just across the way:WASHINGTON, DC   SEPTEMBER 16: Pro-Trump security forces try to keep people away on the National Mall on September 16, 2017 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)You ll note from the captions that these two photos are both by Getty photographer Tasos Katopodis. The Trump rally began, according to the Facebook event page, at 11 AM EDT, while the Juggalo March wasn t scheduled until 2 PM Eastern.The Trumpette organizers have tried to distance themselves from the white supremacists that organized the Charlottesville, Boston, and Portland rallies held in the name of  free speech.  Unfortunately for them, they don t seem to realize that the majority of people who show up at those rallies don t care who the president is, they just want to be allowed to shout racial slurs again without fear of public reprisal.Reaction to the stark difference in attendance was widespread:""The Juggalos outnumber the white supremacists at the Lincoln Memorial today.""   is not a sentence I ever thought I'd write.

 Bill Maher Turns GOPâ€™s â€˜Statesâ€™ Rightsâ€™ Nonsense On Its Head In EPIC Defense Of Liberal Statesâ€™ Defiance Of Trump (VIDEO),"The Republican Party has long claimed that  states  rights  mean that states can do as they like according to their own values, regardless of what the federal government wants. Of course, this is something that has just been used for southern states to do horrible things   like, you know, own people. They used the states  rights argument to justify segregation, to outlaw interracial marriage and abortion, and to basically strip citizens of personal liberty to satisfy the bigots in their citizenry and voting base. Well, comedian Bill Maher of HBO s Real Time has turned all of that on its head in the Trump era.During his  New Rules  segment on Friday night s program, Maher turned it around on the Republicans, pointing out how California s governor, Jerry Brown, is busily defending California s liberal way of life in defiance of Trump s regressive and dangerous administration. Gov. Brown has decided to sign a climate treaty with China, giving a big middle finger to Trump s foolish decision to pull out of the Paris Accord. Maher also pointed out that California will not move to enforce Trump s racist deportation force through its police departments, and nor would there be any attacks on LGBTQ Americans.The real kicker came when Maher adopted a country accent and mocked the insanity of the bigotry of Trump voters   only using it to promote progressive values, such as legalized marijuana and lesbian weddings. He even mocked the tiki torches used last month in a horrifically violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left 32-year-old Heather Heyer dead and injured many others.In short, Bill Maher is right. If they can do this states  rights stuff, so can we.Featured image via screen capture",News
 Ohio Fireman In Deep Sh*t For HORRIBLE Remarks About Saving â€˜N*****sâ€™,"A firefighter in Ohio recently came under fire for expressing his  economic uncertainty  (a synonym the media concocted for  racism  while attempting to explain why people voted for Trump) about rescuing black people.If it came down to choosing to rescue a single dog or  a million n*ggers,  Franklin township firefighter Tyler Roysdon says he would save the dog, which is  more important than  all those African-Americans he hates.According to Roysdon s Facebook  likes,  he is a fan of Donald Trump, Duck Dynasty, and far-Right Facebook group  Uncle Sam s Misguided Children    just so you know what sort of person we re dealing with.Roysdon was suspended from his position  indefinitely  as soon as township officials learned of the post, which went viral on social media because that s what happens when terrible people say terrible things. It s also very likely he will lose his job according to a statement from officials: Recently, a Franklin Township volunteer firefighter posted unacceptable remarks on social media.  Upon gaining knowledge of this information, Fire Chief Steve Bishop immediately contacted the firefighter and directed the comments be removed.  The firefighter was suspended without pay until the Board of Township Trustees could meet to determine a course of action.  Chief Bishop does not have the authority to terminate employees.  Termination of any township employee requires a vote by the Board of Trustees. It s unclear if Roysdon s racism has ever affected his work or if he has caused anyone to die, but this is absolutely something that should be investigated.Featured image via screengrab",News

And yeah, maybe you re a little red-faced if you were among those that spread the GPD post via Facebook share, now that his virulent anti-Semitism is out in the open, and he s been suspended pending an investigation.But there are probably some folks reading this who are genuinely surprised, and this part of the article you re reading is just for you guys:Mike Hamill is a white cop in the Deep South.

 CNN Host Abruptly Ends Segment After Fox Sports Guest Makes DISGUSTING Trump-like Comment (VIDEO),"One thing that most conservatives have in common with Donald Trump   and perhaps contributes to the reason they relate to him and supported him for POTUS   is chronic misogyny and sexism. We saw this play out on Friday during a panel discussion on CNN, when an anchor had to shut the segment down abruptly due to a highly inappropriate comment from her Fox guest.CNN s Brooke Baldwin had Fox Sports Radio host Clay Travis as a guest, and the exchange went downhill very quickly. The panel was addressing the incident in which ESPN s Jemele Hill had called Trump a white supremacist, causing the White House to demand her be fired. When Clay Travis had his turn to give his opinion on the matter, he made Baldwin wish she d never asked him. Travis said this: I believe in the First Amendment and boobs. Baldwin was practically speechless, and had to do a double take, asking him if he d actually just said the word  boobs.  Travis only made it worse: Boobs, two things that never let me down, the first amendment and boobs. Those are the two things I believe in absolutely in the country. Baldwin still couldn t believe her ears, and wanted to give Travis another chance and the benefit of the doubt. She asked him once more to clarify that he d said  boobs  instead of  booze.  Once she confirmed that Travis had definitely said  boobs,  she shut the interview down right then and there. She said: I m done, I m sorry. I m done. This conversation is over, yanking mikes, bye. Forgive me, live television happens and you think you heard something, you are not sure and then you realize it happened, so I apologize for him on that. Right after the segment, Baldwin and Travis were both seen on Twitter, reacting to what had happened in two totally different ways. Baldwin seemed horrified and shocked, and Travis was, of course, proud of himself.What Travis said is not okay, and must be condemned. We re not at all surprised that this would come from a Fox employee, considering how prevalent misogyny, sexual assault, and support for our sexist POTUS is.Featured image via video screen capture ",News
 Ohio Fireman Suspended Indefinitely Over Extremely Racist Facebook Post (VIDEO),"An Ohio fireman from Franklin Township has just been suspended over his Facebook post which contains racist remarks. Tyler Roysdon used his social media account to say that if there was an emergency he would rather save a dog than a  n*gger.  While Roysdon is a volunteer fireman, he does receive payment for each emergency run which he takes part in, according to WHIO.And now, with his social media post easy to Google for any potential employers, he might have a hard time getting a job.Roysdon wrote on Facebook that if he had to choose between saving a dog and an African-American man from a burning building, he would save the dog s life because  one dog is more important than a million n*ggers. Roysdon has just learned a valuable lesson: when you write something on social media, other people can read it. The Facebook post was deleted after Fire Chief Steve Bishop instructed him to do so.At this point. Roysdon s case is under review. Recently, a Franklin Township volunteer firefighter posted unacceptable remarks on social media. Upon gaining knowledge of this information, Fire Chief Steve Bishop immediately contacted the firefighter and directed the comments be removed,  the statement reads.  The firefighter was suspended without pay until the Board of Township Trustees could meet to determine a course of action. Chief Bishop does not have the authority to terminate employees. Termination of any township employee requires a vote by the Board of Trustees. Watch:Roysdon s post didn t go over well, according to the responses. One of them read,  Wow is all I can say  while another commenter wrote,  SMH. The fireman s Facebook page looks like Ted Nugent took a sh*t all over it.Apparently, Roysdon likes to go mudding, shooting, fishing, and now he can start collecting coupons, too, since he ll be in a lower income bracket.

 Hereâ€™s What Companies Admit They Will REALLY Do With Money They Save From Trumpâ€™s Tax Break,"Trump, like George W. Bush before him, thinks a  tax holiday  on repatriated money will spur major corporations who are currently hoarding money overseas to bring that money back and invest it in America. They fail to take into account that, like other tax breaks, companies are not going to build new factories, plants, offices or stores and hire more people if consumer demand doesn t warrant it. Instead, they ll pocket the money they save in one of any number of ways, and regular Americans won t benefit one iota from it.That s what they ll do with Trump s tax holiday. This isn t speculation or conjecture, this is something to which they literally admit. Bank of America Merrill Lynch conducted a survey of more than 300 companies over the summer, asking them what they d do with all that money they bring back from overseas. Their top two responses were the following: Pay down debt, and buy back their own stocks.The idea that they d use the money for stock buybacks is especially upsetting since this is a known method for artificially driving stock prices up. Rich executives and shareholders then get even richer. Workers see no benefit from it, and the unemployed and underemployed don t see new job opportunities popping up.Literally, the whole point of this practice is to make the rich richer.When George W. did this in 2004, companies voluntarily brought over $300 million back in from overseas. $240 million went to stock buybacks. Let that sink in for a moment   80 percent of the money brought back in from overseas went to stock buybacks. Companies took advantage of that tax holiday to inflate their stock prices and get richer. There was no economic growth from that.The companies that brought back the most money actually turned right around and laid people off.Let that sink in as well.There will be no economic growth from Trump s tax break. Companies are not so broke that they can t afford to expand without some of the money they re hoarding elsewhere and protection from repatriation taxes. They don t need this money to build anything or hire new workers. This is nothing more than the government enabling companies to enrich themselves, possibly at the expense of the Americans Trump claims to love so much. The only way to spur economic growth is to help the consumer class afford to spend their money again. But we can t expect that from Trump   he parrots Republican talking points on this because he knows he can use them to make himself and his most loyal rich buddies richer.Featured image via Ron Sachs-Pool/Getty Images",News

" White Security Guard Shoots Himself, Blames Nonexistent Black Guy â€˜With A Small Afroâ€™","On Tuesday night St. Catherine University security guard Brent Ahlers was viciously attacked by an evil black man with a  short afro  who was wearing a  navy sweatshirt  and a gun   at least that s the story he told police after he suffered a gunshot wound while on the job.Ahler s report that he had been shot led to a swarm of 55 police officers and K-9 s, swarming the campus to search for the guy who Ahlers says shot him. The campus was placed on lockdown with  1,800 students held captive in their dorm rooms  according to police spokesman Mike Ernster. The surrounding neighborhood, upon hearing reports of the shooting, began calling 911 in a panic asking officers to check their homes to be sure they were safe.None of it was true. Ahlers lied. As is commonly the case, there was no scary black man with a gun. There was only Ahlers, who brought his weapon to work to prove to himself that he s a badass despite it being against policy. He was nervous about losing his job due to the fact that he had his gun at work, and what had occurred, so he made up the story to cover what had happened,  Ernster said on Wednesday after police had determined that the shooter was Ahlers the whole time.SPPD PIO: St. Kate's security guard admits to shooting himself.

" Trump Claims He Has Done More Against ISIS Than Obama, The Scorecard Says He Is Lying","After a terrorist attack in London, Donald Trump used the occasion to brag about himself and smear President Obama.The United States has been fighting ISIS since 2014. Most of that fighting has been done under the leadership of President Obama.But nine months into his own presidency, Trump is now declaring that he has done more against ISIS than President Obama.We have made more progress in the last nine months against ISIS than the Obama Administration has made in 8 years.Must be proactive & nasty!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2017But, as usual, Trump is completely full of shit.Under Obama s strategy and leadership, the United States military killed over half of the commanders ISIS had and various military strikes wiped out well over 26,000 ISIS fighters (some reports say over 50,000), all while reducing ISIS  territory from a wide swath of the Middle East stretching from Syria through Iraq to just a few remaining city strongholds.In addition, ISIS lost most of their valuable resources and recruitment dramatically declined.And in December 2016, United States officials announced that 75 percent of all ISIS fighters have been killed.By contrast, ISIS cheered when Trump took office and have been using him as a recruitment tool. Trump is also responsible for killing more civilians in nine months than President Obama did in just over two years, which is just helping ISIS radicalize more fighters to their cause.Basically, Trump is waging a desperate destructive campaign to kill the remaining ISIS fighters and leaders so he can boast that he is  doing more  against ISIS. But his campaign is full of unnecessary collateral damage that is only helping ISIS recruit.In military parlance, Trump s campaign is merely a  mop-up  operation, which is what takes place after the military has already gone in and wiped out most of the enemy forces.President Obama s strategy and leadership resulted in ISIS being crippled. Trump is only getting the crumbs that Obama did not have time to finish off. And he can t even get that right because killing civilians is the best recruitment tool that terrorist organizations like ISIS and al-Qaeda (another terrorist group President Obama crippled) use to remain relevant.So Trump can brag all he wants. It doesn t change the fact that President Obama was a better commander-in-chief.Featured Image: Jack Gruber-Pool/Getty Images",News
 Trump Fans Are Crying In Their Milk After Their Hero Breaks Yet Another Promise To Them (TWEETS),"Trump made a bad decision, or so his ardent followers seem to think. His attempts to work something out with Congressional Democrats on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, and also his remarks that current construction on his stupid border wall involves mostly existing fencing, have set off their ire.

They want Trump to do what he promised and damn the consequences to millions who aren t like them.Take Joe Walsh, for example. Walsh is a former U.S. Representative from Illinois  8th district, but his big claim to fame is being a deadbeat dad. All he wants is for Trump to cut his taxes and build the wall.

 Another Russian Turns Up Dead â€“ He Actually Saved The World (VIDEO),"It has just come to light that Stanislav Petrov, a former Soviet Lieutenant Colonel, passed away on May 19 this year in his apartment in the small town of Fryazino, northeast of Moscow. You have probably never heard of him, but if it weren t for Petrov s actions (or lack thereof), there is a good chance you wouldn t be here to read this today.If you have seen the 2014 film The Man Who Saved The World, staring Kevin Costner, then you might have some sort of an idea of who Petrov is, as that movie was based how he prevented a nuclear crisis between the US and the USSR, as well as averting the potential for World War III, back in the 1980s by essentially doing nothing at all. That could be a part of the reason Petrov never considered himself a hero. At first when people started telling me that these TV reports had started calling me a hero, I was surprised. I never thought of myself as one   after all, I was literally just doing my job,  he once said in an interview later in life.The date was September 26, 1983 and Petrov was on duty in a bunker near Moscow, in charge of an early warning radar system. It wasn t long after midnight when Petrov noticed a single missile on the screen, launched from the US and heading toward the Soviet Union. When I first saw the alert message, I got up from my chair. All my subordinates were confused, so I started shouting orders at them to avoid panic. I knew my decision would have a lot of consequences,  Petrov recalled in a 2010 interview. The siren went off for a second time. Giant blood-red letters appeared on our main screen, saying  START.  It said that four more missiles had been launched. This left the Kremlin only 30 minutes from when the warheads were initially fired to decide whether retaliation with nuclear weapons of their own was necessary and Petrov just 15 minutes to determine if the threat was indeed real. My cozy armchair felt like a red-hot frying pan and my legs went limp. I felt like I couldn t even stand up. That s how nervous I was when I was taking this decision. Fortunately for all of mankind, Petrov recalled from his training that, if the US were to attack, they would do so on an all-out offensive, as opposed to simply firing a couple of missiles here and there. Petrov took this into account and declined to tell his superior officers, figuring that a system malfunction must be responsible for the alarm and it turned out he was right; the Soviet satellites had actually picked up sunlight reflected from clouds and mistaken it for nuclear warheads, although Petrov s decision to keep the information from his superiors was a severe infraction of Soviet military rules.The incident was kept as a highly classified secret for years. Even at the time of her death in 1997, Petrov s own wife, Raisa, wasn t aware of what he had done and it was only made public when Colonel General Yury Votintsev, Petrov s superintendent, decided in 1998 that his deed should be commended and told the story to Bild, a German tabloid. German political activist Karl Schumacher was so affected by the article that he traveled to Russia to find Petrov and invited him back to Germany in order to give his version  of how he had saved the world from nuclear war, something that had been a very real threat for decades.In 2006, the Association of World Citizens presented Petrov with an award in the UN headquarters in New York, which reads:  To the man who averted nuclear war.  In 2012, Petrov was also honored with the German Media Prize, which has previously been awarded to Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama and Kofi Annan.Stanislav Petrov was 77 years old.

 Marco Rubio Just Had The Most Hilarious Reaction To Trump Touching Him (VIDEO),"No one likes to be touched by Donald Trump   not even his own fellow Republicans.On Thursday, the full extent of Trump s repulsiveness was on display when he spoke with Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who was also one of his competitors in the 2016 primaries.Trump was visiting Florida on a tour of the damage left by Hurricane Irma, when he took a moment to commend Rubio, who clearly wasn t having it. Perhaps he remembered how disgusting Trump s behavior was while he was running against him in the primaries, so the look on Rubio s face said it all. When Trump approached and touched his shoulder, Rubio couldn t hold back a grimace and nearly shuddered on camera. You can watch this horrible, cringe-worthy moment below:Watch: While standing next to Marco Rubio, Trump says he hopes Rick Scott runs for Senate https://t.co/9cThL4c0S9  NBC Politics (@NBCPolitics) September 14, 2017Trump was encouraging Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) to run for the Senate seat that is now being occupied by Democratic Senator Bill Nelson. Trump said to the cameras: What do I know? But I hope this man right here, Rick Scott, runs for the Senate. It s unclear if Rubio was wincing because he isn t happy with Trump s choice   after all, Scott previously suggested that his millionaire buddy Carlos Beruff should take Rubio s seat   or because he really doesn t like Trump touching him.Rubio would be far from the only person who doesn t want Trump getting that close to him. Recently, reporter Katy Tur detailed a truly disturbing encounter she had with Trump, which resulted in the POTUS planting an unwanted kiss on her cheek. It has also been widely documented that First Lady Melania Trump winces or looks extremely uncomfortable whenever Trump touches her. It s clear that there s definitely something wrong with Trump s transfer of affection, and it seems to make everyone feel dirty.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News
 Trump Vows To Save America From â€˜Curseâ€™ Of Functional Health Care System,"In a pair of tweets on Thursday afternoon, Donald Trump proved once again how out of touch he is with the American public. Just three months ago, Pew Research published a study showing that a substantial majority of Americans   some 60 percent  feel the federal government is responsible for providing healthcare coverage for all citizens. Not only that, but the formerly-controversial idea of a  single-payer  system, like the Medicare For All bill just introduced with wide Democratic support by Senator Bernie Sanders, was favored by a third of Americans.Trump, however, sees universal coverage, enjoyed by every highly-developed nation in the world except the United States, as a  curse  on the citizens of this country.Bernie Sanders is pushing hard for a single payer healthcare plan   a curse on the U.S. & its people  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 14, 2017 I told Republicans to approve healthcare fast or this would happen. But don't worry, I will veto because I love our country & its people.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 14, 2017Universal coverage was long considered a pipe dream, even as recently as during the primary campaign between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Secretary Clinton dismissed it as an  idea that will never, ever come to pass.  But buoyed by the popularity of Senator Sanders after the disastrous win by Donald Trump in November, the Democratic Party has moved decidedly left on the issue.At the time of Sanders  introduction of his bill, painted as the sane alternative to the Republican frenzy to strip all Americans of non-private health coverage, there were a number of Democratic senators signed on, including those widely considered to be front-runners for the Democratic nomination in 2020. Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, and even the favorites among Clinton loyalists, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand, all joined Senator Sanders in introducing Medicare For All. They were joined by Tammy Baldwin, Richard Blumenthal, Martin Heinrich, Mazie Hirono, Pat Leahy, Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley, Brian Schatz, Jeanne Shaheen, Tom Udall, and Sheldon Whitehouse.The irony, of course, is that even if one considers universal coverage a  curse  as Donald Trump does, the bill stands essentially no chance of passage in the first place. Trump would love to portray himself as a savior of conservative principles, but with Republicans in firm control of Congress (at least until 2018), the odds of Trump even needing to look through his plethora of gold-plated pens to find the one for vetoes are slim to none.",News
 Trump Just Bragged About The Size Of His Hands At Hurricane Irma Relief Event (VIDEO),"The size of Donald Trump s hands seems to be an issue, even with the so-called president. Marco Rubio mocked the size of Trump s tiny hands during the campaign last year.  He is taller than me, he s like 6  2 , which is why I don t understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 5  2 ,  Rubio said at the time.  Have you seen his hands? And you know what they say about men with small hands.  At a Republican debate, Trump held up his hands and said to the audience,  Look at those hands. Are those small hands? For the second time in two weeks, Trump brought up the size of his hands while helping out with hurricane relief.  On Thursday, Trump was in Naples, Florida not doing a photo-op. Trump was getting ready to pass out sandwiches, then he fudged up putting his gloves on, according to a White House pool report.

My hands are normal hands,  he said.  I was on line shaking hands with supporters and one of the supporters said,  Mr. Trump, you have strong hands, you have good size hands.  And then another one would say,  Oh, you have great hands, Mr. Trump. I had no idea.' This all began around 30 years ago when Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair magazine, described Trump in Spy magazine as a  short-fingered vulgarian. Later, Carter said that he wrote the Sky magazine comment in 1988  just to drive him a little bit crazy. It worked.

 Racist GOP Rep. Steve King Goes BALLISTIC Over Trumpâ€™s DACA Deal,"This is what happens when racists don t get their way.With a single deal, Donald Trump enraged his racist base, including Iowa GOP Rep. Steve King.On Wednesday, Democrats announced that they had struck a deal with Trump to revive the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program put in place by President Obama to prevent the deportation of 800,000 people who were brought to the United States as children by their undocumented parents.When Trump first scrapped the program, his conservative base cheered while the rest of the nation expressed revulsion.But Trump also left the issue to Congress, thus opening the door for legislative action to save the program. So, Senator Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi offered Trump a deal. DACA will be restored and enshrined in law and Trump will get some enhanced border security that does not include a giant useless expensive wall.Trump took the deal and now conservatives are furious.In fact, Steve King went on CNN to whine about the deal and even threatened Trump with political ruin. The base will leave him   they can t support him anymore. I am talking about my constituents in Iowa that will say you need to be behind trump. I am. I support his entire agenda  I support the agenda Trump had when he went into office and I support almost every piece of the agenda   except the amnesty piece being dangled, and that s so destructive to a first world country. If you do not have the rule of law or respect for that law, the people writing the immigration laws are the people breaking them. We had a protest here, DREAMers coming up demanding we give them amnesty. What right do law breakers have to make demands from the citizens of the United States of America. If anything, they should be pleading for it and not demanding. King also predicted that,  Things are going to be going downhill real fast or the Republicans will be done for 2018 and 2020. Here s the video via YouTube.Amnesty is term used for people who broke the law. These 800,000 people did not break any law. Their parents did. These children had no control over their parents  actions and did not understand that a law was being broken. Therefore, these children should not be forced to go back to a country they know nothing about. America is their home.Furthermore, King is a seriously depraved individual if he thinks these people should have to beg to stay in the country. They did nothing wrong. But King is clearly showing that he lacks compassion and is nothing more than a racist who has no business being a member of Congress.Featured image via screenshot  ",News
" Kid Rock Just Had His First Political Rally, And It Was Worse Than Youâ€™d Imagine (VIDEO)","Robert Ritchie, AKA Kid Rock, has shown quite a bit of interest in running for the Senate in Michigan over the last few months, which would pit him against incumbent Democrat Debbie Stabenow.

One of the first occured at a show on September 6 at Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan, a performance that had already garnered it s share of criticism and protesters before it even began, due to the artist s history of using the Confederate flag as a prop, something Rock has tried to justify as  Southern pride,  despite the fact he hails from Detroit. Yes, this is a man who is considering running for office.Kid Rock opened the night s performance with a new track entitled  Greatest Show on Earth and then the entire arena went dark. A campaign banner was projected on a screen and a voice announced over the public address system  Ladies and gentleman, will you please welcome the next senator of the great state of Michigan, Kid motherf___ing Rock.  Red, white and blue lights came back on and Rock made his way on to the stage and settled behind a lectern with a parody of the presidential seal that read  United States of  Merica  while  Hail to the Chief  played in the background.What followed was completely surreal as Rock stood at the podium, flanked by two women resplendent in white business shirts and hot-pants, and rhymed his way through an offensive, expletive-laden speech that, in comparison, made Donald Trump seem as reserved as a kindergarten teacher during his presidential campaign and, really, was a speech only Kid Rock could deliver. Rock covered all of the hot topics over the following four minutes between periodic bursts of guitars and thrusting, touching on sensitive issues such as health care and racism, while also calling out single mothers that rely on government assistance and white supremacists. He even went as far as considering the possibility of being President, pondering the potential of being able to grab his own junk while addressing the nation!Watch the madness that was Kid Rock s rant unfold here, however, a word of warning, there is quite a bit of coarse language.

Unfortunately, ESPN has refused to stand beside her, stating that Hill s views are not shared by the network.On top of that, recent comments by Trump s White House Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders pretty much stated that Trump and his corrupt administration believe that stating the truth about a president should be a considered an offense that could get someone fired.It s clear that Trump and his minions hate being called out, especially when it s true. Proving that his supporters are just as horrible and racist as he is, Trump voters came out in droves to react to Hill s tweets   and actually ended up proving her right.

 McDonaldâ€™s Manager To Hispanic Customer: â€˜Can You Spell Deportation?â€™ (VIDEO),"An employee working at a North Carolina McDonald s was captured on camera telling a Hispanic customer on Saturday to spell  deportation.  The Charlotte woman said she went to a local McDonald s over the weekend when a woman who is identified as a manager at the store flipped her off, then kept repeating Donald Trump s name, then asked,  Can you say deportation? Can you say that? Can you spell deportation? Wendy Rios told Fox 46 that she filmed the confrontation because she had been treated unfairly there previously. I am the kind of person who thinks,  Treat the person the way you want to be treated,'  Rios said.Rios told WECT that the manager seemed angry when she went to pay at the drive-thru and was yelling at other employees inside the store, but when she asked about her food at the second window, the employee lashed out at her. I asked the employee if my order was ready and the manager asked him what I asked. He told her and she said,  Of course her [expletive] order is ready ,  Rios said.  Then I asked for ketchup and he handed me two packets of ketchup. I asked for more ketchup and the manager yelled at the employee,  What is she still doing here?'  Rios said.  He told her I was asking for more ketchup and she started yelling at me and saying bad words. Rios asked for the manager s name, and a male employee promptly wrote it down but she couldn t read it so she asked again.The manager wrote down her name in big letters on the receipt, Rios recalled, but refused to give her last name, so at that point, the customer pulled out her cell phone.The woman is seen on the video footage giving Rios her middle finger. Can you say, Donald Trump? Donald Trump. Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Yes, Donald Trump, Donald Trump. Can you say Donald Trump?  the manager asked.  You holding up my line, lady. You can stay there all you want. Can you say deportation? Can you say that? Can you spell deportation?  the woman said.  What you need to do is you need to get the [expletive] on. That s what you need to do. Rios posted the video on Facebook and it went viral, garnering 5,000 shares. Rios said that she feels sorry for the woman. Maybe she wasn t thinking straight,  she said.  Maybe she was stressed or something. But I m stressed, sometimes I m really, really angry with something but I m never going to say something discriminating. Watch: McDonald s issued a statement to say the woman is no longer employed by the giant fast food chain. The actions of this employee are inexcusable and in no way reflect the strong values McDonald s and my organization place on diversity, inclusion and providing a welcoming experience for our customers. This individual is no longer employed at my restaurant and we have expressed our sincerest apologies to the customer for this situation.

 The Trump Administration Is Helping Scam Universities Steal Money From Their Students,"Trump s Department of Education is delaying action on requests for student loan forgiveness from those whose money was stolen by the scams that are for-profit universities while they work to erase everything Obama tried to do to protect those very same students. The Trump administration, while claiming they re  draining the swamp,  has brought more of the swamp into the federal government than anyone, and the people working at DOE are sympathetic to these scam universities, not their victims.It s true that a lack of action isn t the same as telling students defrauded by these places that they ll have to continue making their payments or face the consequences. However, that same lack of action is harming students and their families who are on the hook for loans they took out on false promises they d be able to get good jobs with their degrees. They re now stuck in a limbo that s teetering towards the for-profit education scam.Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute both closed their doors under President Obama, who forgave more than $600 million in loans to their students. That s $600 million in stolen money for which students were off the hook. But that was Obama, who tried to do things that helped ordinary Americans even in the face of unprecedented GOP obstruction. Trump and his administration?Everything they do favors the few over the many, even when it includes stealing, which is what misrepresenting yourself and taking people s money based on that misrepresentation is.Trump himself has been sued more than once over his fraudulent  Trump University  because that program was literally nothing but lies built upon lies. Trump U. took people s money and gave them nothing in return. Other for-profit universities promise students jobs in their fields within just a few months of graduation, but charge exorbitant tuition and have a history of forcing students to forfeit their right to sue as well as making promises they can t back up.Obama tried to eliminate the arbitration clauses for-profit universities were forcing on their students. Betsy DeVos, Trump s education secretary, says that students shouldn t be the victims of fraud, but also said that certain standards protecting students were unfairly applied.So DOE is allegedly working to change that. But since Trump himself operated a scam university, it s only natural that he and his administration are going to see the profit side of things more than they will the defrauded-student side of things. Fraud is nothing more than another way to put dollars in their pockets, and it s clear that they d rather help scams rake in even more money than help real people.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News
 BREAKING: Someone Else Connected To Trump Is Under Investigation For Colluding With Russia (DETAILS),"Today, more bad news for Trump broke as yet another person related to the Trump administration comes under federal investigation. Michael G. Flynn, the son of Michael Flynn and infamous for his role in spreading the Pizzagate conspiracy, is under investigation for his role in colluding with Russia.It s likely he s as guilty as the rest of the Trump team, as he works closely with his father.NBC reports:Michael G. Flynn accompanied his father, for instance, on a trip to Moscow in December 2015 for the elder Flynn to deliver a paid speech at a gala for the state-sponsored Russian television network RT. He can be seen in video from an associated event.The elder Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general and a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, was seated at the same table as Russian President Vladimir Putin during the dinner. Records released by the House Oversight Committee show he was paid nearly $34,000 for his speech; RT also paid for Flynn and his son s airfare to Moscow and lodging at a luxury hotel from Dec. 9 to Dec. 12. Several legal experts with knowledge of the investigation have told NBC News they believe Mueller, following a classic prosecutorial playbook, is seeking to compel key players, including Flynn and Manafort, to tell what they know about any possible Trump campaign collusion with Russia. Mueller has brought onto his team a federal prosecutor known for convincing subjects to turn on associates. Any potential criminal liability for Michael G. Flynn could put added pressure on his father, these legal experts said.In other words, any pressure put on Junior is pressure on the old man, who reports have repeatedly indicated the federal government is trying to flip.This is also just one more name at the end of a long, long list of Trump associates with shady connections to Russia. It s pretty clear that Trump thought the campaign was a business opportunity, never expected to win, and wanted to use the opportunity to build Trump Tower Moscow as well as other projects. He courted Russian investors, sought approval from Putin s government and then accidentally won the election, instead of just coming close. There is no other explanation for how amateurish and sloppy these cover-up attempts have been.Featured image via Addicting Info",News

 Texas Trump Fan Threatened To â€˜Whipâ€™ Black Man â€˜Like The Slave You Areâ€™ Before Executing Him,"It s no secret that Donald Trump s rabid, uneducated fans are dangerous. The latest example of this is 38-year-old  economically anxious voter  Kevin Parnell.Parnell became furious when his biracial stepdaughter was arrested for prostitution and blamed it on her ex-boyfriend, Jordan Briggs. Parnell sent a number of colorful messages to Briggs calling him a  n*gger  and threatening to  hang  him. I m going to strip you naked and whip you like the slave you are,  Parnell said in one message. You were warned,  he posted publicly on Facebook, then ten he hopped in his white pickup truck and drove to the apartment Briggs shared with  his roommate, Sammie Jones. He banged on the door three times,  Briggs told the  Star-Telegram.  I told Sammie not to answer. I went to the back and instantly froze up. Sammie had answered the door. You know what kind of gun this is, boy?  Briggs heard Parnell say to Sammie.  It is a Glock 40. Then he heard the gunshot that took Sammie Jones  life. Parnell, whose Facebook profile is unsurprisingly littered with posts supporting Donald Trump, closed the door and ran away like the coward he is. Sammie was being so calm,  Briggs says.  He just shot my bro in the face and burned off. Parnell remains behind bars on $500,000 bond, but he ll be happy to know his stepdaughter s case was dismissed.At this point, it s safe to say anyone who supports Donald Trump is a Nazi, a racist, a white supremacist, a bigot, a xenophobe, or is someone who is perfectly OK with all of those things and fine with being surrounded by those sorry excuses for people.. This is getting dangerous.Featured image via screengrab",News
 White Supremacist Marine Kicked Out Of The Corps After Being Busted Doing Nazi Stuff,"The best way to not get fired, get kicked out of school or booted out of the military if you re a Nazi, is to not do Nazi stuff. Apparently, one Marine just couldn t stop himself and was arrested at a pro-Confederate rally (where we re totally sure it was just about his  heritage ), and took it upon himself to unfurl a banner with a white supremacist slogan   allegedly.Staff Sgt. Joseph Manning was stationed at the Marine Corps Engineer School at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina at the time he was arrested on May 20th in Graham, North Carolina, and charged with first-degree trespass, a Class 2 misdemeanor, the Military Times reports.Manning and fellow active-duty Marine Sgt. Michael Chesny are accused of climbing a building and unfurling a banner with the letters  YWNRU  on it, The Times-News reported on May 27. The letters reportedly stand for  You will not replace us,  which is the slogan for Identity Evropa, a white nationalist group founded by Marine veteran Nathan Damigo.How Nazi is that you ask? Well, you didn t ask but that s the same slogan we heard in the Vice video which showed Nazis storming the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia during the  Unite the Right  hate-rally which rocked the nation and resulted in one Trump-supporting white supremacist using his car as a weapon to mow down anti-racist protesters, killing one and injuring at least 19 others. The  You will not replace us  chant from racists turned into  Jews will not replace us  during the march.Manning is presently in the process of  being administratively separated from the Corps,  according to the Military Times.Capt. Joshua Pena, a spokesman for Training and Education Command, said the investigation is part of the administrative process and its results cannot be released publicly.Manning s career in the Marine Corps lasted 15 years, beginning in 2002, His military awards include the Purple Heart, Combat Action Ribbon, Iraq Campaign Medal, and Afghanistan Campaign Medal and he threw that all away so that he could act like a f*cking Nazi. And even though his banner read,  YWNRU  (you will not replace us), he was certainly  replaced. Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.",News
 Trump Shamefully Uses Hurricane Devastation To Promote Tax Cuts For The Wealthy,"Leave it to Donald Trump to exploit a tragedy.Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma have left parts of Texas and Florida in ruins. Americans are dead because of these storms and the resulting floods.I ll say that again. People are dead.But that isn t stopping Trump from using the storms to promote his tax reform policy, a policy that would mostly benefit the wealthy while slashing the very revenues that contribute to paying for a strong Coast Guard, a prepared FEMA, and the organizations that predict and track hurricanes.On his Twitter Wednesday morning, Trump urged Congress to begin work on tax reform.The approval process for the biggest Tax Cut & Tax Reform package in the history of our country will soon begin. Move fast Congress!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 13, 2017Trump then told Congress to pass tax reform because of the hurricanes.With Irma and Harvey devastation, Tax Cuts and Tax Reform is needed more than ever before. Go Congress, go!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 13, 2017For most Twitter users, this didn t make any sense.This makes no sense. Hurricanes are going to require more federal government spending. That means cutting taxes will just hurt relief effort  Ed Krassenstein (@EdKrassen) September 13, 2017Actually, those hurricanes suggest action on climate change is needed more than ever before.  Miranda Yaver (@mirandayaver) September 13, 2017Also decreasing revenue of government may impact the ability to help fund relief efforts for those that need it most.  Michael Romano (@Romano_PoliSci) September 13, 2017 What? How are the two connected? Who is paying for the relief if you continue to cut taxes?  Calvin (@calvinstowell) September 13, 2017Indeed, Trump s tax plan would give tax giveaways to wealthy individuals and corporations. So while the rest of us are paying more than our fair share to keep the government running, people like Trump and corporations like the Trump Organization will be able to shirk their own responsibility.Right now, we need taxes. Trump is already growing the deficit that had been shrinking under President Obama. Now he wants it to skyrocket with tax cuts that won t do a damn thing to help this country. All such tax cuts will do is further strangle already cash-strapped government agencies like FEMA that Americans need more than ever.What this country needs most is higher taxes on the wealthy, not lower.Trump should be ashamed of himself for using these two tragedies to push his greedy tax plan. It s an insult to the millions of Americans who have been affected.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News
 Chainsaw MASS-acre: This Nun Is Doing More For Irma Victims Than Leather-Face Trump,"On Tuesday afternoon, Miami-Dade Police tweeted a picture and an amazing video of one Sister Margaret Ann helping with cleanup from Hurricane Irma.

Mike Pence is probably about to give Mother her afternoon peck on the cheek, so he can t really grab a rake or a shovel.

Congratulations to Eric & Lara on the birth of their son, Eric ""Luke"" Trump this morning! https://t.co/Aw0AV82XdE  Donald J.

But with a new baby to fawn over the genes of, and his Twitter to maintain, there s no way that Donald Trump has any time to be helping with any silly hurricanes. After his administration started talking about withholding Harvey aid, did anyone actually expect any different?All I know is, that s one bad-ass nun.

 WATCH: Russian Politician Gloats On LIVE TV That Putin Stole Our Election,"Donald Trump may call anything related to his administration s collusion with Russia as FAKE NEWS, but you know who disagrees? Russia.Russian politician Vyacheslav Nikonov appeared on Sunday Evening with Vladimir Solovyov  where he shocked everyone by coming out and saying that, yes, Russia did steal the election. The U.S. overshot. Their intelligence services all slept through Russia electing the U.S. President,  Nikonov said, clearly shocking the host who seemed to have no idea how to respond (especially since the wrong response could have gotten him assassinated).  What kind of intelligence service is that? As we speak, Mueller s investigation of Donald Trump is heating up as The Donald s campaign is forced to turn over documents. Many Republicans speculate that he s  going for the kill. This is all very bad news for Trump, who has managed to bamboozle his Faithful into believing that the Russia investigation is a liberal lie designed to smear him   one in which the FAKE NEWS media is complicit.Watch Rachel Maddow report on the remarks below:?BREAKING VIDEO?

 OOPS: Trump Forgets That Heâ€™s A Twitter Obsessed Narcissist Who Talks About Himself,"Donald Trump is a complainer, but he really only has himself to blame.Long before Election Day in 2016, a lot of books and articles had already been written about Trump, but since taking office, news about Trump has skyrocketed.For some reason, Trump has a problem with it.Fascinating to watch people writing books and major articles about me and yet they know nothing about me & have zero access. #FAKE NEWS!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 12, 2017I myself have written about Trump so many times that I have to take mental health breaks from time to time.Trump has apparently forgotten that everybody has access to him. Not only that, the man is constantly talking about himself   he can t keep his mouth shut. Over the years he has appeared on radio and television, and has even repeatedly phoned into Fox News.Trump s Twitter feed alone is a rich source that has spawned thousands of articles and, yes, it could fill a book or two.It s never-ending for him. He is obsessed with being the center of attention and if he s not he will do or say something to become the center attention.Trump is such a public person that it makes sense that there s enough material out there to fill up books and give journalists and bloggers things to write about on a daily basis.Trump s other problem is that people who have personal access to him, such as aides and White House staffers, are leaking information. That s how the media has a good idea of what is going on inside the White House.It s how we know Trump s White House is chaotic.Make no mistake, Trump is whining because he thinks every book and article written about him should be nothing more than propaganda that makes him look good.But as long as he keeps acting like a buffoon on Twitter (and during public appearances), he can expect the truth to continue to be written whether he likes it or not.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News
" Reporter Destroys Trumpâ€™s Homeland Security Advisor On Climate Change, This Is Brilliant (VIDEO)","The Trump administration has been getting absolutely pummeled for its refusal to acknowledge climate change, even as it becomes more obvious in our surroundings.On Monday, CNN s Jim Acosta tore Trump s Homeland Security advisor, Tom Bossert, apart in front of everyone for the administration s ignorance. Acknowledging the fact that several massive hurricanes have been ravaging the United States, Acosta cornered Bossert, asking him if Trump and his administration  saw a connection between climate change and homeland security and that the frequency and intensity of powerful storms like Harvey and Irma can pose a problem for future administrations  and if the storms were  giving the administration some pause when it comes to the issue of climate change and homeland security. Bossert was almost beside himself as he said: Causality s something outside of my ability to analyze right now. We continue to take seriously the climate change, not the cause of it, but the things that we observe. Then, Acosta nailed him and the entire Trump administration for their stupidity and ignorance: When you see three category 4 hurricanes all on the same map at the same time, does the thought occur to you,  Jeez, you know, maybe there is something to this climate change thing and its connection to powerful hurricanes?  Or do you just separate the two and say,  Boy, these are a lot of hurricanes coming our way? Bossert, nearly crumbling in front of the entire room of reporters, responded: There is a cyclical nature to the hurricane seasons and I thank the scientists for their forecast on this particular one. They were dead on that this would be a stronger and more powerful hurricane season with slightly more than average large storms making landfall  So we ll have to do a larger trend analysis at a later date. Trump s administration is being challenged by the obvious evidence for climate change, and now they re being called out for it. No one can ignore what is currently happening in our environment, and the enormous impact it will have if Trump s administration doesn t wake up.

 A Florida Pizza Hut To Irma-Fleeing Employees: You Will Be Disciplined If You Leave,"Residents in Florida who work at a Pizza Hut were told by the manager that workers would be disciplined if they evacuated due to the deadly hurricane that barreled down on the state. A photo quickly circulated on Twitter of a memo posted for employees in one Jacksonville Pizza Hut location, which included a list of instructions for employees according to the Washington Post. To all Team members,  the memo begins, then lays out a policy that dictates that employees cannot evacuate more than 24 hours before the storm, and then must return within 72 hours.  Failure to show for these shifts, regardless of reason, will be considered a no call/no show and documentation will be issued,  it states.  After the storm, we need all TM s available to get the store up and running and serve our communities as needed. Pizza Hut wants its minimum wage employees to risk their lives for corporate profits. (@KatiSipp) pic.twitter.com/r8rwb3O7I6  Jacobin (@jacobinmag) September 11, 2017We re not sure how drivers can deliver pizza during or following a storm, even for a whopping $7.91 per hour, which is totally worth risking your life for. After all, you re a  team member. Obviously, a backlash ensued on Twitter, probably because most people don t want to see Pizza Hut employees die.@pizzahut why do you threaten workers who flee Irma?This is sick!  brucewayne (@centurysavior) September 11, 2017@pizzahut You guys are closed on Christmas, but sending delivery drivers to their death for a hurricane? What's up with that?  Avery (@Avyrey) September 11, 2017This is sick  Serena Vega (@Serena_vegaYT) September 11, 2017Because the first thing I'm concerned about in a Cat 5 storm is whether or not I can get a stuffed crust pizza delivered.  Josva Oedon ?? (@gtch603) September 11, 2017Pizza Hut has been taking a lot of flak and issued a statement. We are uncompromising in our commitment to the safety and well-being of our team members,  the statement begins.  All locations in the path of Irma are closed and will remain closed until local authorities deem the area safe. We absolutely do not have a policy that dictates when team members can leave or return from a disaster, and the manager who posted this letter did not follow company guidelines. We can also confirm that the local franchise operator has addressed this situation with the manager involved,  it concludes while confirming that the manager of the store did indeed tell his or her employees that they would be disciplined for fleeing from a deadly hurricane.But not all Pizza Hut restaurants are bad. A Pizza Hut in the Houston area participated in relief efforts and handed out free pizza pies to Hurricane Harvey victims. One Pizza Hut manager, Shayda Habib, took it upon herself to use a kayak in order to deliver free pizza to people who were stuck in flooded homes.

 Never Forget: Donald Trump Bragged About Having The Tallest Building In Manhattan After 9/11,"I ll bet if you go to your kitchen and look at the calendar by your fridge, in tiny letters at the bottom of today s date it says  Patriot Day.  If not, don t worry   the official title for today s remembrance only began in 2002, the year after the terrorist attack that changed almost everything about the way our nation conducts itself. The word  patriot  means different things to different people, and we won t pretend to speak for them all here. But we know it when we see it, and we know the opposite of it, as well.Patriotism is what we see when we watched Americans coming together in grief and solidarity, helping each other in the aftermath of the attack. The opposite of it is what we saw when former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani politically invoked the attacks so much that Vice President Joe Biden once remarked that all Giuliani needed  to make a sentence is a noun, a verb, and 9/11.  Patriotism was on the face of our last President, holding a soup ladle in a national day of service in 2011. The opposite is what you call it when Rush Limbaugh attacked him and said he was  visiting the beneficiaries of his policies. Patriotism, in the words of Clarence Darrow,  hates injustice in its own land more than anywhere else. What it does not do is tout itself as superior. We see nothing but that from Donald Trump. When Trump lied on national television   one of more than a thousand times he s done so since his election   and said that he heard Muslims  cheering  the fall of the towers, perhaps what he was actually doing was projecting a little bit of his own guilt onto adherents of a religion he doesn t and has no desire to understand.Maybe, just maybe, Donald Trump felt a tiny bit bad for saying the worst thing anyone in America said on that fateful day in 2001: 40 Wall Street actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan, and it was actually, before the World Trade Center, was the tallest-and then, when they built the World Trade Center, it became known as the second-tallest. And now it s the tallest. What s at 40 Wall Street? The 71-story Trump Building.Listen here, if you can.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",News
 Fox News Just Compared Slave Owners To 9/11 Victims. Seriously (VIDEO),"Nobody can accuse Fox News of being sane most of the time, particularly when it comes to some of their talk shows. Take Fox & Friends, for instance. Their hosts have extremely poor analytical skills and extreme conservative tunnel vision, but they press on with their bullshit anyway. Today is the 16th anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, so Fox & Friends is talking about it. But they obviously can t do it without politicizing it, and they ve done so in an extremely disgusting way.They voiced their problems with the ongoing removal of Confederate statues from public spaces, and decided to try and appeal to people s emotions about them by complaining that, once liberals are done removing Confederate statues, they ll go after things like 9/11 memorial statues and monuments.No, really, they did that.Speaking to Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who was talking about the memorial of United Flight 93 on the show, host Brian Kilmeade actually asked this question: Do you worry that 100 years from now someone is going to take that memorial down like they are trying remake our memorials today? Because the people who stopped terrorists from flying Flight 93 to its target are totally the same thing as people who advocated for the continued ownership of African-American. Of fellow human beings. The passengers on that plane died intentionally to prevent further tragedy. The Confederacy sought to preserve a tragedy that had already endured for thousands of years.Big difference, guys.And a horrifically insulting and inappropriate comparison to boot. Kilmeade might as well have tried to claim that the passengers of Flight 93 acted out of a desire to see the terrorists win. Zinke seemed uncomfortable with the question and tried to stumble his way out of it, and ultimately failed: I m one who believes, you know, that we should learn from history. And I think our monuments are a part of our country s history. Since we don t put up statues of Jesus, everyone is going to fall morally short. I think reflecting on our history, both good and bad, is a powerful statement and part of our DNA. I m an advocate, again, of learning from our monuments, understanding the period they were made. He ended with saying that, regardless of our differences, whether we re Republican or Democrat, monuments are a tribute to all of us.Oh, please. Just when we thought the entire administration had hit bottom, we find yet another freaking shovel with an order to start digging again. Zinke s complicit in this vile comparison now.

" Trump Praises Coast Guardâ€™s Hurricane Relief For All The Wrong Reasons, What He Said Is Awful (VIDEO)","Leave it to Donald Trump to disrespect both the heroes and victims of a massive hurricane.Earlier today at the White House, Trump spoke with reporters about the devastating effects Hurricane Irma will have on Florida and the surrounding areas. Trump also assured everyone that he would be traveling to the damaged areas soon to provide assistance. But what grabbed everyone s attention were Trump s comments to the Coast Guard as he praised them for their efforts.Everything started well as Trump commended the Coast Guard for their response to the hurricane. However, Trump ruined his speech by showing America that he still doesn t know how to be presidential and cannot tell the difference between what is appropriate and what is not in a dire situation. While Hurricane Irma rages on, Trump felt it was the perfect time to talk about the Coast Guard s branding. Yes, really. Trump congratulated the agency on raising its image, completely overshadowing any praise about their efforts. Trump said: A group that really deserves credit is the United States Coast Guard. What they ve done   I mean, they ve gone right into that, and you never know. When you go in there, you don t know if you re coming out. They are really   if you talk about branding, no brand has improved more than the United States Guard. Once again, it s very clear that even in times of great tragedy and danger, all Trump cares about or pays attention to is image and ratings. This was totally disrespectful to the Coast Guard as well as to those suffering due to Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. Branding is the last thing we should be concerned about here.You can watch Trump s ridiculous speech below:Pres.

" Florida GOP Official Tried To Murder A Teen With A Claw Hammer, Refuses To Resign","Back in May, Republicans in Broward County elected Rupert Tarsey secretary of their GOP affiliate. Little did they know they had actually elected Rupert Ditsworth, a former student at LA s Harvard-Westlake School, a $40,000 per year preparatory academy in California. More than a decade ago, Ditsworth attacked a fellow student at H-W, Elizabeth Barcay, hitting her over the head at least 40 times with a claw hammer after a date to Jamba Juice gone awry, before dumping her out of the car and fleeing.After the attempted murder, Ditsworth s parents enlisted a psychiatrist to try and suss out why their son may have beaten a girl within an inch of her life. No word on whether the shrink was any use, other than that Rupert still claims he was defending himself and went on to work on the Trump presidential campaign before running for election to the Broward GOP.So that s a no.Now Florida Republicans are understandably freaking out. The Fort Lauderdale area is largely Democratic, and having a party secretary who once split open the skull of a high school girl tends to cast an organization in a dim light.Tarsey, as Rupert is now known, doesn t see what the problem is. He sat down for an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com at his $2 million beachfront condo: Why should I resign? I did nothing wrong and I was elected. This is just party politics. Tarsey insists his name change has nothing to do with his horrific attack on a defenseless young woman with a deadly weapon.  I m estranged from my dad,  Tarsey says. Perhaps the broken skull, nose, and leg that the girl suffered at the hands of his 6-foot-2 son explains why dear old dad may have created some distance between them.The chair of the Broward GOP, Bob Sutton, was apoplectic: We were blindsided. He s a member of the Knights of Columbus for Christ s sake. And he came highly recommended by the former chair.We had no idea what his background is. We want him out but he is refusing to resign. He deceived us. It looks like he even used a reputation management firm to make sure we wouldn t find out who he is. It really is a shame that Republicans aren t better at figuring out that members of their party are horrible monsters. Perhaps if they started with the racists, sexists, and homophobes, they might get better at spotting the guys with the claw hammers in their closets.Featured image via screen capture",News
" â€˜Shoot At Hurricane Irmaâ€™ Facebook Event Taken Too Seriously, So Police Had To Issue A Warning","A Facebook event called  Shoot At Hurricane Irma  popped up just before the powerful storm made landfall in Florida, and apparently people took it seriously enough that the police felt they had to issue warnings not to do it.Over 80,000 people responded to the event, which tells us two things: One, that the event s young and naive creator, Ryon Edwards, had no freaking clue what he was really doing; and two, that people really are dumb enough to accept this on its face rather than question it. That s probably more true of right-wing gun nuts than anything since the nuttier part of the right loves any excuse to shoot off their firearms.The Pasco County Sheriff s Department, concerned that idiots might actually try this, tweeted the following in response to the interest in the event:To clarify, DO NOT shoot weapons @ #Irma. You won t make it turn around & it will have very dangerous side effectshttps://t.co/CV4Y9OJknv  Pasco Sheriff (@PascoSheriff) September 10, 2017It s a tiny bit like firing your weapon straight into the air. What goes up, must come down, and the bullets can come down on perfectly innocent people and cause serious injury. In the case of a hurricane, the bullets can get spun around, more or less, and come back to you or someone near you. That warning tweet has been retweeted nearly 30,000 times.Edwards claimed that he created the event out of  stress and boredom.  The response apparently was a complete surprise to him, with him saying that he never thought this would get so out of control. People have allegedly even created graphics that show how to shoot at the hurricane  correctly,  and other Facebook events have appeared, with one suggesting using flamethrowers to stop the hurricane.It s really hard to tell what s sarcasm and what s not sometimes, especially for, well, stupid people. Edwards would have been better off finding something else to do with his  stress and boredom,  because yes, people really are that stupid.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News
 WATCH: Black Driver Bravely Shames Cop Who Drew His Gun Over A Turn Signal Infraction,"When you are Black in America, getting pulled over by a cop   even for the smallest infraction   is a very scary thing. As we have seen repeatedly, this could cost you your life. Usually, when that happens, the cop in question faces no real consequences. Generally, the police department investigates itself and finds it did nothing wrong, naturally. So, to that end, Black Americans tend to act with extreme compliance when it comes to interactions with police. Not being that way could cost us our lives. However, one brave black driver who was pulled over for not using his turn signal properly decided that he s had enough, and confronted the cop who pulled him over and approached with a drawn gun.The whole incident was caught on video, as the man goes all in on the cop, saying: Big f*cking crime right? Big crime. A crime enough for you to come with your fucking gun pulled out, right? A turn signal not made is a big enough crime for you to need to take out your service pistol. Do you have no conscience? You just don t give a f*ck right? Because I would have been just another dead black motherf*cker right?  the man tells the officer.  And you would have just gone about your business, right? Luckily, the officer didn t shoot, and just accepted this rightfully outraged driver reading him the goods on his racist behavior. It s too bad more encounters with racist cops making unfounded assumptions about the supposed dangerous criminality of Black Americans can t end this way.Now, time to find out who this cop is.Watch the priceless video evidence of America s racist policing problem below:Cop pulls over a black man for failure to signal, walks to his car with his gun drawn  Black dude is my fucking hero????????????????????? pic.twitter.com/S8ef8Mx4Kk  SIX_FOOT_5 (@Choco_Optimus) September 10, 2017The ending of black dude going ham on cop  Left him looking stupid as fuck! ? pic.twitter.com/9oCHBbCBRi  SIX_FOOT_5 (@Choco_Optimus) September 10, 2017Featured image via video screen capture",News

 New Hampshire Cops Intent On Protecting Sadistic Racist White Teens Who Tried To Lynch A Biracial Boy,"It s 2017, and lynchings of black people still happen, just as they did during Jim Crow. Case in point- how an 8-year-old boy in New Hampshire nearly lost his life because of some racist white teens who hung him from a tree with a rope. Luckily, the child was able to remove the rope himself and make it home.The whole incident started when the victim, a Claremont, New Hampshire resident was playing outside. The teens in question allegedly hurled racist slurs at the child, who is biracial in a 96% white town, and threw rocks and sticks at him. Things escalated when they all stood on a picnic table and took turns putting the rope of a tire swing around their necks. Then, they took the child and, according to Lorrie Slattery, a grandmother of one of the kids present, took the child and said: The (teenagers) said,  Look at this,  supposedly putting the rope around their necks,  Slattery said.  One boy said to (her grandson),  Let s do this,  and then pushed him off the picnic table and hung him. He swung three times before he was able to get down, and wound up having to be flown to a hospital for life-saving treatment. What is most appalling is how little national media attention this is getting. Further, Claremont Police Chief Mark Chase wants to make sure these horrific little racists are  protected  due to their  mistakes.  He won t even say whether or not there will be criminal charges, and certainly is not releasing their names. In fact, the only reason this is getting any attention at all is because the boy s mother, Cassandra Merlin, posted the following images on social media:This is a story that needs to blow up nationwide until this child receives justice. These attempted murdering racists need to be thrown in jail for the foreseeable future and charged with a hate crime. I won t hold my breath on it, but spread it far and wide. Make it go national until they have no choice but to act.It s the least we can all do.Featured image via screen capture from The Root",News
 Two Florida Lawmakers Just Voted Against Hurricane Relief As Irma Strikes Their State,"Two Florida Republican lawmakers voted against a $15 billion hurricane relief bill just as Irma churned toward the state. Congressmen Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and Ted Yoho (R-FL) claim they have concerns about other provisions of the measure. Irma is now a Category 3 storm with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph but forecasters expect the storm to strengthen. Presently, the Florida Keys is facing a potentially catastrophic force that could threaten to drown entire islands.But, it s obviously more important for Gaetz and Yoho to exercise their conservative bonafides.The relief package sailed through the Senate and the House and was signed by Donald Trump on Friday. The package boosts funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a necessary move at this time following the destruction left by Hurricane Harvey and much more expected after Florida feels Irma s force and fury. Also, FEMA is running out of money so the funds are needed.The package will also raise the debt ceiling for three months and includes a short-term budget that would keep the government running until December. The deal struck between Trump and Democratic leaders Sen. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) sent Republicans into a panic while disregarding that lives are at stake after the deadly storm obliterated Houston, Texas.The Washington Post reports:That latter was a problem for GOP Reps. Matt Gaetz and Ted Yoho, who stuck to their principles of fiscal conservatism despite calls from fellow Florida lawmakers to support the bill. The two, who are among the 90 House Republicans who voted against the bill, do not represent parts of the state that are likely to feel Irma s immediate impact as the massive storm makes landfall on mainland United States this weekend. Snaking in a debt-ceiling increase with funding for victims and communities affected is immoral and reflective of broken leadership in Washington,  Yoho said after the vote Friday.  I do not think it wise to extend our borrowing limit without mandatory spending reforms . . . If this was a clean measure that focused on those affected by Hurricane Harvey, I would have proudly voted for it. Gaetz, whose district includes coastal areas along the Gulf of Mexico, said the debt limit should be raised only if it includes cuts in entitlement programs, which is really heartless since many victims of the Hurricanes will need a hand up after losing everything they owned in the world. I have a pretty strident view that I will only vote to raise the debt limit if that vote is accompanied by reductions in entitlement spending,  Gaetz said.  If conservatives don t start voting no against debt-limit increases, all the FEMA in the world won t save us from our most unfortunate destiny. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) was against federal aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy, then a natural disaster struck his state with deadly force. Suddenly, he s cool with aid being provided to his state. Funny how that works. But the other two Republicans just don t want to help anyone, even their own constituents.Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images.",News
" New Study Proves That Trump Supporters Are Racist, Infuriated By Black People (IMAGE)","Despite the fact that Donald Trump and his fanbase try to convince everyone that they re not racist whenever they get called out, the verdict is in   and it s exactly as we suspected.Conservatives have been trying to convince everyone that their politics and values are about lowering taxes and minimizing big government, glossing over the fact that most of the time their policies will hurt minorities. Well, there s finally a proven reason for that   it s because, plain and simple, conservatives are racist as hell. And even worse, they have a particular fear of African Americans.In a study reported by Vox, Trump supporters can be set off just by looking at a picture of a black person, and just seeing one can significantly change how they feel about a policy. This was discovered thanks to a new study by political scientists at Colgate and the University of Minnesota, which shed light on some of Trump supporters  most racist behaviors.In the study, conservative participants were asked how they feel about housing assistance. The participants were divided in their support, however, when the researchers threw in a twist, it was discovered that Trump voters were WAY more likely to support housing assistance when they were shown an image of a white person. When they were shown a picture of a black person, it was a completely different story.And it gets worse   not only were the Trump supporters less supportive, but they actually became angry! Just by looking at an African American person, Trump supporters got mad. The authors of this study, which was called Supporters and Opponents of Donald Trump Respond Differently to Racial Cues: An Experimental Analysis,  wrote:We find that white Trump supporters randomly exposed to a black (versus a white) man in the context of soliciting their support for a housing-assistance policy were more opposed to the policy, angrier about the policy, and more likely to blame beneficiaries for their situation.So now we know that no matter how conservatives try to twist their justifications for not supporting certain causes that directly affect black people, the underlying issue is really that they re racist.Featured image via Mark Wallheiser  / Getty Images",News
 Red Cross Raises Tens Of Millions And You Wonâ€™t Believe What Theyâ€™re Feeding Hurricane Victims,"Americans are opening their wallets and donating to relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey and with Hurricane Irma almost about to hit land in the U.S., people would be wise to be wary of which charity organization to give money to. For example, a survivor of Hurricane Harvey will be fed by the Red Cross but the food might kill them.The cauliflower doesn t even look cooked and it sits next to a few slices of what looks like ham along with crackers instead of bread.It isn t clear what the percentage of donations to the Red Cross goes to victims. The charity organization claims that 91 percent goes to victims but that s far from the truth. A Houston councilman has asked for people to not donate to the Red Cross, an organization which affords its executives with a hefty salary. I beg you not to send them a penny,  Houston City Councilman Dave Martin said at Wednesday s council meeting.  They are the most inept unorganized organization I ve ever experienced. Don t waste your money,  Martin added.  Give it to another cause. A study released by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) claims that the Red Cross had spent $124 million   one-quarter of the money donors gave for earthquake relief in Haiti in 2010   on internal expenses.Since Hurricane Harvey hit Texas, the Red Cross has collected $211 million, according to USA Today.This Catholic charity claims that 100% of donated money goes to the victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.We are the official disaster relief agency of the US Catholic Church. 100% of funds go to #Harvey & #Irma relief. https://t.co/QaFD3UYALX  CatholicCharitiesUSA (@CCharitiesUSA) September 9, 2017To its credit, the Red Cross is a massive first-response organization which has sheltered and fed (see picture above) hundreds of thousands of people.A good chunk of Donald Trump s $1 million donation to victims of Hurricane Harvey went to the Red Cross..@realDonaldTrump releases list of charities he donated to for Hurricane Harvey relief. pic.twitter.com/Tb51qQJd2I  David Fahrenthold (@Fahrenthold) September 6, 2017We re not suggesting that the Red Cross feed ribeye steaks and lobster tails to hurricane victims, but geez, how about throwing together a sandwich with a few extras for the hungry survivors who are left with nothing in the world due to a natural disaster.Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images.@RedCrossHouston & @RedCross what kind of meal is this?!

 â€˜Pharma Broâ€™ Faces Prison Time For Offering To Pay People To Assault Hillary Clinton,"If you ve spent months or years telling Martin Shkreli,  Pharma Bro  as he is more commonly known, to go  fuck  himself, you ll be pleased to know he did just that.Shkreli, known for jacking up the price of life-saving medication, is currently out on bond while awaiting sentencing for securities fraud, but that may be a temporary condition of prosecutors have their way.Recently, Shkreli offered to pay his Twitter followers an obscene amount of money   $5,000 per strand   for Hillary Clinton s hair allegedly for genetic testing. The Clinton Foundation is willing to KILL to protect its secrets. So on HRC s book tour, try to grab a hair from her,  he wrote Monday. I must confirm the sequences I have. Will pay $5,000 per hair obtained from Hillary Clinton. Payment after the sequence matches. Good luck, patrollers. Apparently, ordering people to assault the former First Lady   a threat that has led to increased Secret Service protection   isn t such a good idea when you re out on bond.Citing this threat as well as others Shkreli has made toward other women, prosecutors say his bond should be revoked because he represents a  threat to the community. Prosecutors say that because of Shkreli s hit job, the Secret Service expended significant additional resources to ensure Secretary Clinton s protection. The government respectfully submits this motion for a bail revocation hearing, at which the government will move to revoke the defendant Martin Shkreli s bail and remand him into custody,  the prosecutor s motion reads.  His recent public conduct demonstrates that he cannot meet his post-trial burden to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that he does not pose a danger to the community. Shkreli has represented a  danger to the community  for quite some time, but it s nice to see people trying to get him away from society for a while.Featured image via screengrab",News
 Another Pervert Out At Fox News Over Allegations Of Sexual Harassment,"Fox News has a problem with sexual predators in its ranks. Their gross corporate rape culture is costing them television personalities left and right. First, it was the now-deceased mastermind behind the network, Roger Ailes. Then it was Bill O Reilly (who was, by all accounts, their main star) who had to be canned to save the network s brand after millions were paid to his victims. Now, it is happening again   only this time it is Eric Bolling.Bolling had his own program, called The Specialists, which was relatively new, but he had been with the network for a decade. Fox News released a curt statement that read: Fox News Channel is canceling The Specialists, and Eric Bolling and Fox have agreed to part ways amicably. We thank Eric for his ten years of service to our loyal viewers and wish him the best of luck. There was no mention of the sexual harassment charges, but that was clearly the reason. Bolling has been accused of sending lewd photos of penises to female Fox News employees. Bolling, for his part, is, of course, denying the allegations. His lawyer released a statement that reads: Mr. Bolling recalls no such inappropriate communications, does not believe he sent any such communications, and will vigorously pursue his legal remedies for any false and defamatory accusations that are made. This all comes on the heels of Bolling being suspended after Yashar Ali of the Huffington Post came out with an explosive report regarding Bolling s conduct in the workplace. Bolling is filing a $50 million lawsuit against Yashar for character defamation. It likely won t go anywhere as no one in their right mind would write such a story without concrete evidence.That network of right-wing propaganda needs to go down the toilet with the rest of the sewage. They are misogynistic, racist, and all around bigoted to their core. They are also pathological liars who should not be allowed to call themselves  news. So long, Bolling. Hopefully the rest of that vile network follows.Featured image via Logopedia",News
 Trump Official Gets Asked A Simple Question About Global Warming. Her Response Is Unbelievable. (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s administration finds new ways to look foolish on a daily basis, and Trump s staff is more than willing to pick up the slack whenever their boss isn t behaving like a big enough idiot.On Friday, Trump s acting assistant administrator for Asia, Gloria Steele, made sure that she humiliated America and the Trump administration when she was left uncomfortably speechless by a simple question about climate change. The question was asked by Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA), who wanted to know if climate change has  anything at all to do with  rising sea levels in reference to the massive flooding in Bangladesh. Connolly asked Steele: Could the fact that a third of an entire sovereign nation Bangladesh being under water, could it have anything at all to do with, I don t know, the warming of the climate? Just like most of the incompetent people staffed on Trump s administration, Steele doesn t know a damn thing about the position she s in. Steele was obviously unprepared to answer any real questions about the matter, because all she could do was smile and let her mouth hang open as she was left clueless and speechless. This is an absolutely inappropriate response to a simple, straightforward question, but Steele could do no better.It turns out that Steele is taking after her boss in being completely ignorant. Trump himself has called climate change a  hoax  many times, and has even blamed the Chinese for being responsible for its creation. Trump s denial of facts and evidence on climate change is so dangerous that he made the United States one of the only three countries to oppose the Paris Climate Agreement. The stupidity of Trump and his administration are major threats to the future of the climate, and it s clear that they don t have any of the answers that the planet needs.

 Equifax Is Tricking Consumers Into Waiving Their Right To Sue Over Data Breach,"Equifax, the oldest and most valuable of the three main credit reporting agencies, revealed a massive data breach; one of the largest such hacks ever recorded. Personally identifying information like Social Security numbers, birth dates, and even driver s license numbers were involved in the breach, affecting up to 143 million people   nearly half the U.S. population.Naturally, anyone who with any credit at all will want to know whether or not their info was involved in the incident, and Equifax says they want to help. But now, concerns are being raised that Equifax is deceptively requiring consumers to waive their rights to join any class action lawsuit against them, should they enroll in the company s fraud protection program and possibly if they even use the website to see if they ve been affected.PSA: If you check Equifax's site to see if your data was stolen, you *waive your rights* to sue Equifax or be part of a class action suit. pic.twitter.com/p4AlmmLQ3r  Zack Whittaker (@zackwhittaker) September 8, 2017That s right   if you enroll in their fraud protection something they specifically provided to you because of the breach you automatically agree to arbitration and lose your right to sue. It s currently unclear whether this applies to merely checking to see if your information has been compromised.Outrageous. The website for the Equifax ID monitoring service Equifax is telling victims to sign up for includes an arbitration clause. pic.twitter.com/G7kSbrOsjS  Matthew Preusch (@mpreusch) September 8, 2017The website, which, for obvious reasons, we will not provide a clickable link for here, is equifaxsecurity2017.com.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB ) is actually trying to ban arbitration clauses like this, specifically because they can be so deceptive. But those rules have not yet taken effect, and won t for another ten days. More importantly, the rule will not work retroactively, so consumers can t get out of this arbitration if they follow through with the sign-up process on the Equifax site.New York s Attorney General has already contacted Equifax about the arbitration clause:This language is unacceptable and unenforceable. My staff has already contacted @Equifax to demand that they remove it. https://t.co/vT0x7f5Xhc  Eric Schneiderman (@AGSchneiderman) September 8, 2017The CFPB said in a statement that the clause was  troubling,  and that they were investigating both the security incident that set this all off and the company s response to it, saying that  Equifax could remove this clause so that consumers can receive this service without condition. Not only is Equifax requiring an agreement that strips you of your legal rights, but even if you decide you don t care about all that, the company requires you to provide even more personal information as you sign up for the resolution tool.Featured image via media library",News
" With Irma About To Strike Florida, Trump Begs For Donations To His Re-Election Campaign","Trump has been tweeting about Hurricane Irma sort of for the last couple of days. His tweets mostly consist of bragging that his emergency teams are ready and telling people to stay safe. But while he s pretending to be concerned, he s also sending out messages begging people for donations; not to the charities and rescue organizations that are, and will be, on the ground in Florida during and after Irma, but to himself and his 2020 campaign.He s not even making a pretense of asking for donations to help him help those in Irma s path. Seriously. This is what he s sending out to his followers:The link in the above image goes to the donation page on Trump s campaign site, where a video again attacks career politicians and the media, and goes into his usual spiel about  Let s finish the job,  and  Make America great again.  It s ridiculously tone-deaf in light of how many are scrambling to aid those in Irma s path.He bragged about his response to the devastation of Hurricane Harvey, but he s not really doing anything but tweeting about Irma and closing Mar-a-Lago ahead of landfall. He s made a Facebook video that, like his tweets, urges people to get out of Irma s way, but many don t have that choice.The federal government has three major relief efforts to deal with right now: Ongoing recovery efforts in Texas and Louisiana, live-saving efforts in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (where Irma has already hit), and evacuation and preparation efforts in Florida, which is more or less closed and in chaos.Trump will  monitor  Irma from the safety of Camp David and beg for donations to his campaign instead of do some real work.His timing for this kind of a message is especially poor. If he wants to ask for donations, fine. But he should be directing people to donate to the non-profits and other organizations that are on the ground everywhere in Irma s path and put his stupid, vapid campaign on hold. His priorities are clear, and they do not lie with the American people.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News
 Five â€˜All Americanâ€™ Football Players Booted From Team With Black QB After KKK Display,"The city of Creston, in the heart of Iowa, sits nestled between State Route 25 and U.S. Highway 34, only a mile from the eastern bank of Summit Lake. The seat of Union County offers two additional lakes to fish in, the glorious Green Valley State Park, and a high school football team full of terrifyingly virulent racists.At least, Creston had that last one until Thursday. Scheduled to play the Clarinda Cardinals Friday night, the Creston Panthers will suddenly find themselves without five of their starters after a viral photo of them wearing hoods and posing with a burning cross, a rifle, and a Confederate flag, made the rounds on social media earlier this week.Clearly, the players didn t do well in history at Creston High. The location of the school in Union County is a stark reminder of which side Iowans fought for in the Civil War.The boys will probably not face legal difficulties. Being a piece of shit KKK member, or even pretending to be one, is protected under the First Amendment, and in a town of fewer than 10,000, it s not likely there s a lawyer in town who could successfully argue that anyone suffered damages as a result of their racist idiocy. Not even Kylan Smallwood, the Panthers  quarterback, who is black. Sadly, Smallwood is already all too aware of the fact that this will blow over like nothing happened once the incident is forgotten. He won t forget, though: It s a bad way to put our town on the map, but I think as a community, we just have to move past it. Deal with it, I guess. I thought these guys were my friends. Like, I ve been to some of their houses before I wanted to ask them why, why they did it, but I haven t had the chance to yet. For their part, Creston High School has said that the students have been punished in addition to their removal from the team, but has not specified what that punishment was. Coach Brian Morrison called the families of each boy personally to tell them their sons were no longer playing for the Panthers.Just another day in post-racial America.Featured image via video screen capture",News
 Trump HUMILIATES Republicans In Latest Hissy Fit After Siding With Democrats On Debt Ceiling,"Donald Trump sure knows how to add insult to injury.Republicans in Congress must be seriously regretting their decision to endorse Trump now after they were totally humiliated on Thursday at the White House.During a meeting inside the Oval Office to discuss debt ceiling proposals, Trump stunned Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell by taking a deal offered by the Democrats which increases the debt ceiling for three months and provides Texas with Hurricane Harvey relief with no strings attached. Republicans were hoping for an 18 month increase and wanted to hold hurricane relief hostage in order to get concessions from the Democrats on other issues.But Trump pulled the rug out from under them because he knows that Republicans are incapable of governing even with majority control of the House and Senate.And that s why Trump kicked Republicans while they were down on Friday morning, suggesting he took the Democrats  offer because of Republican failures to pass legislation. He then whined about the filibuster and asked Republicans to work on tax reform and get it done before the end of the month.Republicans, sorry, but I ve been hearing about Repeal & Replace for 7 years, didn t happen! Even worse, the Senate Filibuster Rule will .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 8, 2017 never allow the Republicans to pass even great legislation. 8 Dems control   will rarely get 60 (vs. 51) votes. It is a Repub Death Wish!  Donald J.

He d not only get things done, he would be able to sign legislation that is far better for the country.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News
 GOP â€˜Moderateâ€™ Under Attack From The Far Right Will Not Seek Re-election,"We recently reported on how the far right is waging war against a dying breed: Congressional Republicans who at least attempt to be compassionate and reasonable in their policy-making. At the top of the list for these far right lunatics  antics has been Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA), who is the co-chair of the moderate Tuesday Group in the House Republican conference. Dent has obviously been feeling the pressure from his less reasonable comrades, as he will not seek re-election in the 2018 midterms.This really isn t that surprising. Increasingly, the ultra conservative Freedom Caucus has gained power in the House Republican conference, and they and their followers have absolutely no problem ousting people who won t fall in line with their extreme far right agenda. It was this group that unseated former House Speaker Eric Cantor, and forced the most recent former House Speaker, John Boehner, to resign. So, perhaps Dent has the right idea here. He says of his decision: I ve worked to instill stability, certainty and predictability in Washington. I ve fought to fulfill the basic functions of government, like keeping the lights on and preventing default. Regrettably, that has not been easy given the disruptive outside influences that profit from increased polarization and ideological rigidity that leads to dysfunction, disorder and chaos. This, of course, is likely a nod toward those who are directly attacking and threatening Dent and other members of his Tuesday Group caucus. They see no way out when it comes to sustained political attacks by Trump minions and other nationalist types with alarming far right views.Now, as for how this helps us on the left? Den t district is a swing district. If we get our act together and run a good candidate in a good race. Get your act together, Democrats. As the GOP eats their own, these so-called  moderates  who aren t even bothering to run again out of fear of getting primaried by the far right can become Democratic seats. They are in swing districts, not solid red ones. The best way to #RESIST is to make sure we have a Democratic House of Representatives.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News
 Don Trump Jr. Testified To The Senate Today And They Donâ€™t Seem To Believe A Word He Said,"Donald Trump, Jr. went before Congress today to give yet another version of his reasons for meeting with a Russian lawyer in June of 2016. While he did actually confirm what he said in the email string he was dumb enough to post to Twitter that he met with Natalia Veselnitskaya because she claimed to have dirt on Hillary he gave a ridiculous reason for it. His reason was that he was trying to determine Hillary s fitness for office, because that s a totally innocent reason that makes it all okay.So that makes it all innocent, especially because he also claimed that he was just so overwhelmed with the campaign due to inexperience, but he did still evidently have the presence of mind to know he should talk to legal counsel about the propriety of the meeting and info, or so his claim goes.Some, however, on the Senate Judiciary Committee don t believe him, it seems. Sen. Chris Coons, who sits on that committee, sent out a memo to  interested parties  about Don the Con Jr. and his testimony today, complete with the statute regarding giving false testimony to Congress. And there s no ambiguity about it   the top of the memo says: Below is a statute to keep in mind in regards to Donald Trump Jr. s testimony today. It quotes the full statute, which states that it s illegal to lie to Congress, and then Coons says: It is important to remember that anyone who testifies in front of a Senate committee is under the restrictions of the False Statements statute that says material false statements to Congress are criminal and punishable with fines or imprisonment or both. Read Coons  full memo below:? After Don Jr. testimony to Senate Judiciary Cmte, Sen. Chris Coons  office sends out statute on giving false statements to Congress pic.twitter.com/OUdKXMBfqm  Andrew Desiderio (@desiderioDC) September 7, 2017The many contradictions in Don Jr. s reasons for meeting with Veselnitskaya clearly raise doubts that his testimony today was the truth. He first claimed, months ago, that he didn t meet with any Russians, and then later claimed that meant he didn t meet with any known Russian officials. Then he claimed that he did meet with a Russian attorney, but it was about adoptions. After that, he said he did meet with her, but it was because he was told she had dirt on Hillary. He said the meeting was a fruitless endeavor.Now he says it s because he wanted to determine her fitness for the presidency, which he seems to think makes it all okay. Coons is right to be skeptical. It would be one thing if the junior Trump s story had never changed, and contradicting information had never come out. But it s impossible to trust the testimony of someone who s changed their story as many times as he has.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",News
" Vegas Cops Take Cheap Shot At Michael Bennett, Say â€˜Hidingâ€™ During Shooting Is Probable Cause","Now that Seahawks star defensive end Michael Bennett s harrowing story of police brutality has gone viral, the cops who arrested him are trying to cover their own asses in a PR-fueled letter to the NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell. In the letter, Detective Steve Grammas, the president of the Las Vegas Metro Police Protective Association, asks Goodell to open an investigation into Bennett s allegations, and requests that the commissioner  take appropriate action. The irony is rich in seeing a letter asserting that the LVPD isn t racist, even as the first paragraph of it calls out the NFL for  condoning  Bennett s protest during the national anthem, a stance that only racists take.Bennett s protest, along with that of many players around the league, is specifically against police brutality when dealing with unarmed, innocent black  suspects.  To continue to insist that it is somehow disrespecting to  everything the flag symbolizes  is to ignore that the flag symbolizes justice as well.But the truly disgusting part of Grammas  letter is the reason he and the Las Vegas Police attempt to use as justification for having unlawfully detained Bennett in the first place. Grammas actually asserts that hiding behind a slot machine, then running outside during an episode in which shots are being fired is considered probable cause to arrest Bennett for  suspicious behavior. Guess what, geniuses? If Mike Bennett was running from the cops, you all just proved him right to have done so. He clearly has no gun, obviously isn t the only person in the entire casino hiding from the gunfire, and wasn t even remotely the only person running out the doors   Bennett himself said that  hundreds  of people were staging an exodus from the scene.One would think that maybe the guy with the Super Bowl ring on who kind of looks like Michael Bennett and can leap over a four-foot barrier might not be their suspect.It is my most sincere hope that Bennett and his lawyers not only sue the department, but Detective Grammas personally, for being the kind of dumbass who would send a self-contradictory letter like this in a case where he s clearly just trying to fire back at Bennett s allegations.Featured image via Mat Hayward/Getty Images",News
 BREAKING: Under Trumpâ€™s Leadership FEMA Could Run Out Of Money By Tomorrow,"After Hurricane Harvey devastated Houston, Texas, then Irma barreled through the Caribbean on its way to Florida, two Senate Florida Senators are warning that the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will run out of disaster assistance funding on Friday unless Congress approves more money.Republicans in the House had been looking at cutting almost $1 billion from disaster accounts to help finance Donald Trump s ego-wall on the Southern Border and now that a natural disaster occurred with another expected to hit Florida, the optics would look really bad for the GOP and for the former reality show star.Trump s budget includes slashing FEMA s budget:But the response to the next Harvey could face even stricter financial constraints if President Donald Trump gets his budgetary wishes for the 2018 fiscal year, which begins October 1. The president s budget blueprint calls for FEMA s budget for state and local grants to be cut by $667 million, saying that these grants are unauthorized or ineffective.However, after Hurricane Harvey unleashed its wrath with more storms coming, Senate Republicans agreed to more than double funding to $15.25 billion to FEMA and local block grants to handle natural disasters, according to Reuters. FEMA is stretched, and, of all things, FEMA runs out of money unless we act by tomorrow,  Democrat Senator Bill Nelson said during a speech on Thursday following a letter he wrote with Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio to congressional leaders warning that more funds were necessary.FEMA had just over $1 billion on hand as of Tuesday, and that s less than half the $2.1 billion it had last week. We re not going to let money get in the way of saving lives,  FEMA director Brock Long told CBS on Wednesday.  Congress knows what they need to do. A Senate vote is planned later on today.On Wednesday, the House voted 419-3 to pass a $7.85 billion package to help victims of Hurricane Harvey.Reps. Justin Amash (Mich.), Thomas Massie (Ky.) and Andy Biggs (Ariz.) were the only lawmakers to oppose the aid.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News
 Trump Just Accidentally Admitted Climate Change Is Real (VIDEO),"Somebody must have put some truth serum in Little Donnie s Cheerios this morning, because first thing this morning, he tweeted something that was actually nice about a federal agency that his Republican cohorts love to denigrate   FEMA:Hurricane Irma is raging but we have great teams of talented and brave people already in place and ready to help. Be careful, be safe! #FEMA  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2017He didn t stop there. During a joint press conference at the White House with the Emir of the State of Kuwait, Amir al-Sabah on Thursday, Trump was asked if he thought FEMA was being  spread too thin  with all of the crazy weather events happening right now. Not only did he acknowledge how well FEMA was handling both Hurricane Harvey and the impending storms that have yet to come aground, but he noted that the media was actually doing their job and reporting non-fake news! Well FEMA is doing an incredible job, as you all know. I mean, you ve been reporting it. You ve seen how incredible they are. And there s a great bravery to what they re doing. Like I said, something is off when Captain Congratulations has any praise for someone other than himself.But then Trump said something that sounded distinctly like he was acknowledging the existence of climate change: We ve never had a thing like this where you get hit with Harvey, which was about as bad as it gets, certainly from the standpoint of a water dump, and then you get hit with Irma, and there s one right behind Irma. I guess you probably know, but a smaller one, but nevertheless right behind. Now, not to detract from any concessions Donald Trump might be making to science, but I think he might be forgetting Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. No matter, we ll take Trump agreeing with basic facts wherever we can get it.Watch the clip from the joint press conference here:President Trump: ""Certainly we're being hit with a lot of hurricanes. We've never had a thing like this "" https://t.co/xrDzAiaLuv  NBC News (@NBCNews) September 7, 2017Featured image via Chris Kleponis (Pool)/Getty Images",News
 Trump Tells DACA Recipients Not To Worry And Gets Thrashed By The Internet,"Just days after rescinding an Obama policy giving children of undocumented immigrants a path a citizenship, Donald Trump had the gall to tell those children to not worry.The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy resulted in over 800,000 applications   that s how many people face deportation to countries they know nothing about after Trump s delay of six months ends without any action from Congress to keep the program alive.Indeed, none of these individuals are responsible for the actions of their parents. They were powerless to say or do anything when they were brought to the United States. To most of them, America is the only home they have ever known. Deporting them would be cruel and unusual punishment.Six months is not a very long time to wait. And Congress, especially one controlled by anti-immigrant Republicans, does not give these 800,000 people much hope that something will actually get done to spare them from the pain of being forcibly separated from family, friends, and the lives they have built.On Thursday morning, Trump made things worse by telling DACA recipients that they  have nothing to worry about  even though it is very clear that they have everything to worry about right no.For all of those (DACA) that are concerned about your status during the 6 month period, you have nothing to worry about   No action!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2017Trump s message to these 800,000 people lacked any trace of empathy and ignored the fact that they only have six months before Trump s immigration squads come knocking on their doors or kicking them down to drag them away from the only home they have ever known.Twitter users had absolutely no problem trashing Trump s heartlessness.And then what about after 6 months? Will you kick them out of America without any notice?  Ed Krassenstein (@EdKrassen) September 7, 2017It s not the Next 6 MONTHS they are worried about  It s the REST OF THEIR LIVES!!  Impeach Donald Trump (@Impeach_D_Trump) September 7, 2017Imagine if Ivanka Came here at 2 years old from Russia. Imagine forcing her to move back to Russia w/out knowing the language or the country  Impeach Donald Trump (@Impeach_D_Trump) September 7, 2017Obama was clear: that kids brought here by their parents should get a chance to earn their citizenship. That s the American spirit.  Anirvan Ghosh (@anirvanghosh) September 7, 2017Ummm and what about after 6 months? What s the point of creating an arbitrary deadline to mess with people s heads?  Greg Shugar (@GregShugar) September 7, 2017but after that 6 month period .you re screwed  Mike Zoller (@mikezoller) September 7, 2017That s like telling someone who has six months to live that they have nothing to worry about for six months.  Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) September 7, 2017Basically, all their plans for their futures being held hostage. All their accomplishments thus far null and void.  James (@JaySaysStuff) September 7, 2017Essentially Go on living your life, career, education, etc knowing full well it could come to an abrupt end in 6 months.  James (@JaySaysStuff) September 7, 2017And it s not just DACA recipients who are affected by Trump s decision. Everyone in this country would be affected because the economic consequences would be staggering. The economy stands to lose $400 billion if Trump goes through with the deportation of 800,000 people six months from now.So, it s not just DACA recipients who should be worried. Every American should be worried because Trump s hateful decision is going to hit all of us in the wallet.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News
" CNN And MSNBC Destroy Trump, Black Out His Fact-Free Tax Reform Speech (TWEET)","Donald Trump practically does something to criticize the media as being  fake news  on an almost daily basis, but two major news networks have just turned the tables and put him on blast in a major way.The White House is currently up in arms over a recent decision by CNN and MSNBC, who decided not to air Trump s insanely dishonest North Dakota speech from earlier today. Trump was supposed to address tax reform in his speech, but there was a major problem with what he was saying   not a word of it was true. In response to this fact-free speech, CNN and MSNBC decided that it was irresponsible to air the speech and decided to spare Americans the misinformation and nonsense.Once the Trump administration found out about this move by the press, the White House practically threw a hissy fit. Special Assistant to the President and Assistant White House Communications Director Steven Chueng tweeted:Instead of insulting their viewers with Trump s lies, MSNBC s Nicole Wallace reported on important, truthful topics such as DACA and Russia. CNN s Jake Tapper focused on Hurricane Irma, Russia, and the debt ceiling while Trump spewed his usual nonsense.This was a major f*ck you to the Trump administration and sends a strong message that the dishonest narrative that his administration continues to put out to the American people will not be tolerated. While people aren t likely going to react so strongly to a topic as dry as tax reform, having two major networks refusing to air his speech is a big deal. Trump desperately wants and needs that coverage, and is obviously pissed that all eyes were not on him. If more cable news networks break from Trump, his already failing presidency will be in even more danger.Featured image is a screenshot",News
 Trump Tells The Dakotas: I Will Make The Drought â€˜Go Awayâ€™,"Amateur president Donald Trump told the drought-stricken Dakotas that he can make the drought  go away  and told attendees during a tax reform speech that they are  better off  than cities flooded by Hurricane Harvey. I know you have a little bit of a drought. They had the opposite, believe me,  Trump said during his speech in Mandan, North Dakota. You re better off. You are better off, they had the absolute opposite,  the climate change denier said.Trump continued to say that he was surprised that droughts could happen  this far north. We re doing everything we can but you have a very serious drought,  he said.  I just said to the governor, I didn t know you had droughts this far north. Guess what: you have them. We re working hard on it, and it will disappear, it will all go away,  he said.According to a federal drought monitor report which was issued last week, it said there were  long-term precipitation deficits  in parts of the Dakotas, Nebraska and Montana, where 41 percent of the state s pasture and range conditions are rated  very poor,  The Hill reports.Trump said his Agriculture Department has been working closely with states in the region to alleviate the impact of the drought on farmers and ranchers. We will always stand strong with our farmers and our ranchers, the backbone of America, that I can tell you 100 percent,  he added.Trump nominated an Oklahoma politician who is a climate change skeptic to run NASA   an agency which monitors man-made climate change. The former reality show star, a purveyor of fake news, once tweeted that  the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. During the presidential debates, Trump walked it back and said he was  joking  but now that Houston is underwater and Hurricane Irma is pummeling Puerto Rico on its way to Florida and the Dakotas are in the midst of a drought, we re wondering how funny that joke is because it certainly garnered a lot of likes and retweets from his fans.Maybe Trump plans to call Michele Bachmann so she can pray the drought away. Now there s a novel idea.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News
 Facebook Just Confirmed Russia Spent At Least $100k On Ads To Influence Election,"Earlier today, Facebook representatives told Congress something that should shake every American to their core: A shady Russian company bought thousands of dollars worth of ads specifically targeting American voters. $100,000, to be exact. In other words, Russian actors actively sought to influence the outcome of our election.Facebook has traced the ads back to what they re calling a  Russian troll farm,  which is known to spread propaganda friendly to the Kremlin. Some mentioned both Trump and Hillary by name, while most merely worked to stoke fears about gun rights, immigration, and other issues   the same fears that Trump himself stoked during his campaign.With all the brouhaha surrounding  fake news,  and the question of how big a role social media played in the dissemination of fake news that may have unduly influenced our electoral outcome, this is a massive revelation indeed.NBC News posted Facebook s official statement on the matter to their Twitter account. It reads, in part: We have found approximately $100,000 in ad spending from June of 2015 to May of 2017 associated with roughly 3,000 ads that was connected to about 470 inauthentic accounts and Pages in violation of our policies. Our analysis suggests these accounts and Pages were affiliated with one another and likely operated out of Russia. Read their full statement below:Facebook statement: 470 inauthentic accounts  likely operated out of Russia  bought roughly $100,000 in ads between June 2015 and May 2017 pic.twitter.com/XZqvUKB0gG  NBC News (@NBCNews) September 6, 2017How utterly convenient that these ads started popping up right as Trump formally announced his candidacy. This was even before the primary season really got underway, and the GOP field was crowded. At that point, we weren t going to know for months who the GOP candidate would be. Yet, when combined with all the other evidence against Trump and his campaign, such as meetings between Don Jr. and a Russian lawyer, the Trumps  financial connections in Russia, and more, the dark picture of Russian meddling starts becoming a little clearer.Here s the thing: While the amount these Russians spent is just a tiny fraction of overall spending during the campaign cycle, and most of the ads didn t actually reference our election, the targeting was more specific than it ought to have been. That brings up questions about whether these Russian operators had help from within the U.S. when it came to targeting their ads.If they did indeed have help from inside our borders, where did the help come from? Russians already here? Or people close to some of the candidates (like, oh, say, Donald Trump and his family)? Facebook can t determine that, but hopefully investigators will be able to uncover some information about it soon.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News
 Trump Humiliated As DACA Decision Practically Kills His Presidency (DETAILS),"As we saw with his Muslim travel ban as well as his attempt to repeal and replace Obamacare, every time Donald Trump puts forth one of his disastrous ideas, it blows up in his face and delivers a devastating blow to his already failing presidency.Each time Trump introduces an unpopular policy or idea, his already historically low approval rating takes another nosedive. This week, Trump only managed to make things worse for himself when he decided to end former President Obama s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program. Here s the problem   most Americans disagree with him.According to a recent survey from Morning Consult/Politico, almost 80% (76% to be exact) of Americans do not believe that Dreamers (the undocumented immigrants that were brought into the United States illegally as kids) should be forced to return to their countries. The majority of Americans are far more humane than Trump, and believe that these immigrants should have the opportunity to become citizens, as most have been productive members and have contributed greatly to American society.Trump is especially in trouble because his decision to end DACA only offers more proof that he is a racist a**hole. As MSNBC s Joy Reid perfectly pointed out, there is  no economic, national security or social cohesion rationale  for ending DACA: Trump might say that he has  great love  for the immigrants that are living in America, but his decision proves the exact opposite. Trump wants to strip Dreamers of the lives and progress they have made for themselves in this country and force them to return to countries they are unfamiliar with, where they will have nothing.With this decision, Trump is not only screwing himself over by killing his presidency, but he is also basically putting the GOP in great danger in future elections by excluding one of the fastest-growing voting demographics. Trump is sinking the Republican Party   and his presidency   at record speed.Featured image via video screen capture ",News
 Seahawks Star Has Even MORE To Protest Before Games After Police Brutality In Vegas,"One of the most feared defensive ends in football, Michael Bennett of the Seattle Seahawks, posted an account on Twitter Wednesday of his own story of police brutality, and it happened less than three weeks ago.Bennett was in Las Vegas the day after his team bested the Kansas City Chiefs in a preseason matchup. Before that game, as Bennett has the entire preseason, he sat during the national anthem in protest against police brutality nationwide. Number 72 has been an outspoken activist for years, but this year he has elected to actually join other players in protest of the treatment of people of color at the hands of police.As he did previous 2 weeks, Michael Bennett sits during national anthem. As last week, teammate Justin Britt stands at his side. #Seahawks pic.twitter.com/5ko7KG4jT2  Gregg Bell (@gbellseattle) August 26, 2017Ironic doesn t begin to cover what happened to him the very next day. With a statement far too large to fit into even a series of tweets, Bennett posted his account of what happened after the much-hyped fight between Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor in Las Vegas on August 26th:To be clear, Michael Bennett is a very big man. At six-foot-four and 275 pounds of pure muscle, Bennett wears a smaller version of standard NFL shoulder pads so they don t get in his way as he crushes his opponents on the field. But this beast of a man, compliant in every way, finally encountered something that made him fear for his life: The police.Any Seahawks fan   and I am one of the biggest   will tell you that Michael Bennett is the last person that would ever be a suspect in any kind of violent crime. If he seems like a monster when he gears up, it is in polar opposite to his life off the field. He lives in Hawaii with his wife and three young daughters. His brother Martellus, a tight end for the Packers, writes children s books. Michael collaborates with his brother s business, The Imagination Agency. He is a happy man.But today he is not happy. If NFL fans thought they were going to get players to stop protesting during the national anthem by complaining about their patriotism, they should seek out Michael Bennett and ask him how much he loves this country. Bennett is a proud American, standing up against the police brutality that has claimed so many young black lives, and almost claimed his own.Featured image via Elsa (Staff)/Getty Images",News
" Airlines Immune From Price Gouging Laws In Florida, Royally Screwing Evacuees","Imagine you just heard on the news that  the strongest storm ever observed in the Atlantic  was headed your way, and soon. You would, like anyone concerned for themselves and their family, want to get out as soon as possible. And the quickest way to evacuate from anywhere is the fastest method of travel on earth: Air. But you hit a small snag. You don t have the goddamn fortune that the airlines are now charging for flights that were less than half as much the day before. That has to be against the law, right?Wrong. In Florida, where Hurricane Irma is bearing down like a banshee, there are price-gouging laws like there are in every state. But airlines don t answer to specific states. They re regulated by the FAA and the Department of Transportation, which means no state or local statutes apply to them.So when Lisette Diaz tried to book a flight to get her family out of South Florida, she found that flights from the area   during what is normally a lull in the travel season in Florida   had skyrocketed from a few hundred dollars to over $3,000. Trying to get to New York, she finally settled on tickets out of Fort Lauderdale that cost upwards of $1,300 per traveler. According to the Miami Herald, there were four people traveling with her, including her mother, grandmother, adult cousin, and 11-year-old sister. $6,600 later, she had her tickets.Diaz was far from the only person to run into price gouging. Florida s Attorney General Pam Bondi activated the state s price-gouging hotline for travelers to report these egregious acts.The Herald reported that Antonio Mercurius actually got his tickets from Miami to D.C. on Monday, before the pricing spikes. Out of curiosity, he checked the price of the same ticket the next day and found it had gone up more than 800% per ticket. Said Mercurius,I understand supply and demand but the laws of capitalism should not operate in the times of catastrophic danger. What happens to the people that can t afford flights now?People trying to evacuate responsibly before the storm vented their frustration on Twitter:@AmericanAir really charging $2000 for a flight from Miami to DC. Scum I tell you.  The Last DJ Bender! (@djpushplay21) September 5, 2017Searching for flight tickets for my sister, grandma and cousin and they are over 1k from Miami   New York!  Tu Deseo ?

Alex Schwartz (@AlexJSchwartz) September 5, 2017Leave it to the industry that brought you fees for everything from blankets and pillows to a simple name change on a ticket to really kick evacuees while they re down.

" Florida Sheriff Exploits Desperate Hurricane Victims, Will Arrest Anyone With A Warrant Seeking Shelter","Ever since Donald Trump s rise, some of the most heartless people in positions of power have come out of the woodwork   likely because they are emboldened by Trump s being a heartless bastard from the bully pulpit of the White House. Case in point   Sheriff Grady Judd of Florida s Polk County.Of course, Florida is right in the middle of the path of the Category 5 beast known as Hurricane Irma. Therefore, there will be people in need of shelter and safety from the storm. However, instead of trying to help people stay alive during Irma, Sheriff Judd has reminded them that if they have any warrants out and they seek shelter, they will be arrested and taken to jail.  Hell, they even suggest that to make it easier, you should just turn yourself in to the jail instead! This was, of course, announced via Twitter:Here is a screenshot of the relevant tweets, via CNN s Twitter:Of course, this is incredibly dangerous. This man should be doing everything he can to protect the residents of the county he is sworn to serve and protect, not threatening them with jail time for seeking shelter from what could clearly be a very deadly storm. It s like this Sheriff wants people to be afraid to seek help, and ultimately wind up dying in a deadly hurricane. His actions are complete dereliction of duty, and he should be relieved of said duties.Of course, we all know that won t happen. What is more likely to happen is that more deaths occur than otherwise would have because people are too afraid to come forward for help.Featured image via CNN Twitter",News
" Senate Says ENOUGH Of Trumpâ€™s Racism, Will Force Him To Go On Legal Record Condemning White Supremacists","Most of the nation and world watched in horror just a couple of weeks ago as white supremacists, neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members, and other various white power groups descended on Charlottesville, Virginia. Their violent, hateful rally eventually resulted in the death of a brave counter protester, 32-year-old Heather Heyer.As if that weren t bad enough, Donald Trump s response to this racist violence made the situation that had already turned the nation into a tinder box even worse. Instead of condemning white supremacy as any sane, non-bigoted person would, Trump instead made an equivocation between the vile white supremacists and the people there protesting their hate. Only when he was forced to do so did he condemn the violent hate groups by name. However, Trump, being the arrogant, bigoted jackass that he is, could not let that carefully scripted statement stand. In a freewheeling press conference for the ages, Trump ranted for more than half an hour about how the other side was just as bad as the white supremacists. Well, now, it seems that members of the United States Senate are sick of Trump s bigotry and pandering to white supremacists, and they plan to force his hand on the issue.Politico is reporting that a bipartisan group of Senators   Tim Kaine (D-VA), Mark Warner (D-VA), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Cory Gardner (R-CO)- have drawn up a resolution that will have Trump make a legal statement against what happened in Charlottesville. That isn t all it does, though. It also forces Trump, once and for all and on the record, to commit to  rejecting white nationalists, white supremacists, the Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and other hate groups. This is an extraordinary move, considering that resolutions are usually just symbolic in nature and not controversial at all. Generally, they just recognize honorary holidays for people of note and things like that. However, this resolution   dubbed the Charlottesville Resolution   will force Trump to, once and for all, stop winking and nodding at these vile hate groups. Senator Mark Warner said: Let there be no mistake: what happened in Charlottesville was an act of domestic terrorism perpetrated by a white supremacist, one that tragically cut short the life of a young woman, Heather Heyer, who was speaking out against hatred and bigotry. We will be pressing our colleagues to swiftly and unanimously approve this resolution in order to send a strong message that the United States Congress unconditionally condemns racist speech and violence. Senator Tim Kaine said in a statement of his own: During the violent white supremacist demonstrations in Charlottesville last month, our country lost three brave Virginians in Heather Heyer and Virginia State Police officers, Lieutenant Jay Cullen and Trooper Pilot Berke Bates. This resolution honors their lives while supporting the Charlottesville community as it heals and rightfully calls on us all, including President Trump, to do better as we combat acts of hate. The beautiful thing about this is that every single Senator will have to vote in favor of it, lest they be labeled a Nazi sympathizer for the rest of their political careers. While Teflon Don gets away with being an open racist, it has been shown time and time again that these other politicians do not have cults of personality of their own and will not be so fortunate should they attempt the same sort of behavior.To that end, Trump will have no choice but to sign this Charlottesville Resolution, and it will be in the presidential records as long as this republic exists.Featured image via Zach Gibson   Pool/Getty Images",News
 Trump Brags About Hurricane Size As Florida Braces For Disaster,"Donald Trump is apparently thrilled that Hurricane Irma will be the biggest storm to ever hit the United States.Only weeks after Hurricane Harvey left a swath of devastation and death in Texas, Florida is bracing for an even deadlier and more destructive storm.People will die. Businesses and homes will be wiped off the map. Suffering and homelessness will be the reality in Florida. But Trump is too busy bragging about the size of the hurricane to actually care about the people who are in the path of the storm.In yet another Twitter rant on Wednesday morning, Trump proclaimed that his team is already in Florida preparing for the storm after bragging about what a  good job  they have done in Texas.Watching Hurricane closely. My team, which has done, and is doing, such a good job in Texas, is already in Florida. No rest for the weary!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2017In fact, Trump s response to Hurricane Harvey was to brag about the size of that storm, and he ended an Obama-era flood policy as Houston drowned. Trump has also proposed massive cuts to FEMA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which predicts and tracks hurricanes.It should also be noted that Trump inherited a FEMA that took the lessons of Hurricane Katrina seriously in preparation for future storms. So, Trump and his team did nothing special.But what Trump did next on Twitter shows just how little empathy and compassion he has for the people in the path of Hurricane Irma.Hurricane looks like largest ever recorded in the Atlantic!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2017Yeah, you read that right. Trump literally bragged about the size of this hurricane as if it s something to be proud of. This coming from a man who denies the very climate change that is causing bigger and more destructive hurricanes to form.As Floridians prepare for disaster, they must be wondering why Trump is so excited about watching them get slammed by the largest hurricane to ever strike the United States. If anything, Trump should be concerned about the coming destruction and death instead of bragging like he s about to win a prize.Featured Image: Jim Lo Scalzo   Pool/Getty Images",News
" AG Sessions Persuaded Trump To End DACA, Then Race-Baited His Way Through The Speech That Killed It","It s certainly no secret that Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, a man named after both the president of the Confederacy and the guy who actually started the Civil War, is an unholy racist. Like, he s so racist that the wife of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., actually delivered a letter to Congress pleading with them not to confirm him as a U.S. attorney 31 years ago.So it s no surprise to find out that Sessions was the driving force behind convincing Donald Trump to end DACA, the temporary deferment program for undocumented immigrants that protects them from deportation if they came here as children. Sessions sees no difference between an  illegal alien  who steals a car and one who may sit next to one of his 10 grandchildren in school one day.So imbued with the essence of Jeff Sessions was the Trump decision to boot nearly a million kids out of the country in less than a year s time that it was the AG himself who delivered the speech announcing it. And it was during that speech on Tuesday that the former senator from Alabama revealed the truth behind the decision to end DACA: That despite the fact that even many Republicans favor the basic protections that DACA affords, it is racism that serves as the foundation for undoing it. From the speech: The effect of this unilateral executive amnesty, among other things, contributed to a surge of unaccompanied minors on the southern border that yielded terrible humanitarian consequences. It also denied jobs to hundreds of thousands of Americans by allowing those same jobs to go to illegal aliens. This is a direct appeal to the racist tendencies of the Americans who put Donald Trump in office.Number one, the  surge of unaccompanied minors  that Sessions refers to began well before DACA was implemented. To suggest otherwise is a dog whistle to right-wing voters. A BBC report from 2012 showed that the number of unaccompanied minors who were apprehended near the border increased from October 2011 to March 2012 by 93% over the same period in the previous year. DACA was not implemented until June of 2012. Besides that, any who came after DACA was announced wouldn t have qualified in the first place. You had to have been in the United States at the time of implementation to benefit from the executive order.Number two, Sessions brings up the myth of the job-stealing immigrant. The theory, again an appeal to racists, is ridiculous from the start. Immigrants don t even look for the same jobs as native citizens. There is no evidence to support the claim that DACA has had any effect on jobs   other than as a boost to our economy. In fact, with the job losses that will come as DACA expires   something to the tune of 30,000 workers a month   employers stand to lose billions in training new employees, and the federal government will lose tens of billions in lost revenue and GDP.But those facts don t jibe with the Sessions narrative.Don t let the mini-quarrel that Trump and Sessions got into earlier this year fool you. They both have a racist agenda, and this is the first major step in implementing it.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News
 Putin Breaks Up With Trump In HUMILIATING Public Split: He Is â€˜Not My Brideâ€™,"Ever since Donald Trump rode down the escalator at Trump Tower and announced his disgraceful bid for the White House, people have been making jokes about his alleged love affair with Russian autocrat Vladimir Putin. This is more than fair; after all, Putin is the ONE person Trump refuses to criticize. The orange one has viciously attacked everyone from the cast of the hit Broadway musical Hamilton, to Congresspeople and Senators in both his own party and the opposing party, too many celebrities to mention, cable news hosts, and just about anyone else you could think of. But not Vladimir Putin, not ever. The only close second is Trump s bizarre coddling of white supremacists and Nazis.Therefore, it must be the ultimate humiliation to have Putin do the unthinkable to Trump in a VERY public way: and say, and I quote, that,  is not my bride.  According to the New York Times, the Russian dictator seems to be tiring of Trump s chaos. At this point, Putin has spent a lot of political capital on the world stage helping get Trump elected, and yet Trump has failed to deliver sanctions relief, a better U.S.-Russia relationship, or anything else to the brutal dictator. Putin reportedly said of Trump: [He is] not my bride, and I am not his groom. Of course, Trump wants to be seen as a man s man, so to be emasculated by being referred to in the feminine by the man whose bitch everyone has accused him of being is really rubbing salt in that wound. Apparently, Putin made the remarks when being asked about what he thought of the idea that Trump might be removed from office forcibly before his four-year term is completed. Of course, no matter how humiliating this is for Trump, there will be no retaliation. He can t strike out at Putin; after all, this is the one man on the face of the planet who likely has the MAJOR goods on Trump.Now, if only Putin would grow tired of this game and release the most damning information ever and help us end this embarrassing American nightmare.Featured image via Sean Gallup/Getty Images",News
 Pastor Who Prayed At Trumpâ€™s Inauguration Takes DACA Decision To The Woodshed,"Donald Trump s decision to punish 800,000 young people who came to the U.S. as children, and subject them to deportation, isn t going down well. It s almost as if he didn t think before he decided to end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA.Even a reverend who offered one of the prayers at Donald Trump s inauguration called on Tuesday for Congress to act in the wake of the former reality show star s decision to end the DACA program. Hundreds of thousands of Hispanic young people will be overcome with fear and grief today,  the Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, said in a statement, according to The Hill. Simultaneously, a multi-ethnic coalition of tens-of-millions of law-abiding, U.S. citizens will begin to put unrelenting pressure on members of Congress to provide a permanent solution for DREAMers, whose fate is in question by no fault of their own,  he continued, referring to recipients of DACA.Rodriguez blasted politicians in the statement, saying that Hispanic people in this country have been the  political bargaining chips of our powerful politicians  for far too long. This is an affront to the sanctity of life, it is inhumane, and the Hispanic community will stand for it no longer,  he said.Rodriguez then targeted Congress, saying lawmakers expressed concern for the country s Hispanic community but  have chosen to do nothing. We will not distinguish between Republicans and Democrats but between those who stand for righteousness and justice and those who do not,  he added.Statement from Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, who prayed at Trump's inauguration: pic.twitter.com/HgXwAoPMTZ  Betsy Woodruff (@woodruffbets) September 5, 2017Trump, too cowardly to announce his decision to end DACA, had Attorney General Jeff Sessions (R-Racist) do his dirty work for him on Tuesday.Watch Rodriguez s prayer at Trump s inauguration:After the decision was announced, Trump tweeted,  I look forward to working w/ D s + R s [SIC] in Congress to address immigration reform in a way that puts hardworking citizens of our country 1st. Good luck on getting Democrats (or Democrat s, as he put it) to work with you, Mr. Trump, after creating another hot mess.  We need to hear from more Christians, especially the  pro-life  ones, on Trump s decision to kick 800,000 young, hardworking, taxpaying people out of the country.Image via screen capture. ",News
 Obama Pens STUNNING Response To Trumpâ€™s Cold-Blooded Move On DACA â€“ Trump Fans Should Be Ashamed,"Trump is working his tail off to undo absolutely everything President Obama ever did, because the black man who once occupied the White House apparently hated all of America and everyone in it far more than His Royal Orangeness, and that includes ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. That program protects undocumented immigrants from deportation if they were brought into the country as children.That was one of Obama s more controversial executive orders, with Republicans all up and down the line calling it a gross overreach of executive power. But Trump s plan is more insidious than a belief that he s righting the wrongs of the previous administration. He promised to remove 11 million undocumented immigrants from the country, who (in his mind) are here because Obama and the Democrats favor open borders, and by golly, he s going to accomplish that even if it hurts innocent people.Like those protected by DACA.So Obama wrote an absolutely beautiful response to Trump s cold-blooded fuckery on Facebook, naming every single thing wrong with Trump s move, including that it is politically motivated and morally questionable. He also pointed out what should be obvious, but apparently isn t, to anyone who believes the GOP s lies: Kicking [these immigrants] out won t lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyone s taxes, or raise anybody s wages. For eons, the GOP has been sending the message that undocumented immigrants are just one huge burden on us that we can t sustain. White, working-class Americans took that to mean that undocumented immigrants are one of the main reasons they re losing their jobs and can t make any headway in this economy.It s a matter of basic decency, according to Obama. He knows as well as the rest of us that Trump has no decency to him, because if he did, he wouldn t do this, let alone shirk his own responsibility for it by shifting it over to Congress: Ultimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way we d want our own kids to be treated. It s about who we are as a people   and who we want to be. The ending of it is a subtle jab at those who claim strict adherence to the Constitution s letters, but not its spirit, like all those allegedly  Constitutional  Republicans and conservatives who blasted Obama over DACA, and now stand with the Racist-in-Chief on this.

 Trump Staffers Admit Their Boss Has No Idea What DACA Is,"Donald Trump sent a racist elf to make the announcement that his administration is going to punish 800,000 young people, who came to the U.S. as children, and subject them to deportation in an act that Attorney General Jeff Sessions called  compassionate. The Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA, is being terminated by a man who doesn t know what the program is, according to Trump s own administration officials, who said he doesn t fully comprehend what the move to eliminate DACA would mean.According to the New York Times, it was just an hour before the announcement that Trump administration officials privately expressed concern that the former reality show star might not fully grasp the details of the steps he was about to take, and when he discovered their full impact, would change his mind.Trump did not have the courage to face the nation and make the announcement himself and left Sessions to do his dirty work.The perpetrators behind pushing Trump to eliminate the program include Stephen Miller   the amateur president s chief domestic policy aide   who wrote the Trump campaign s immigration plan promising the termination of DACA, and has played a pivotal role inside the White House in pushing Trump to roll back the provision, according to Politico.Steve Bannon and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the latter of which just made the announcement, have also been against the program, even though ending it would hurt the economy.Trump, without even comprehending how upending the program would affect the economy as well as tear families apart, allowed three extremists to call the shots instead of trying to unify the country while it was just besieged by one deadly hurricane   and another category 5 storm is on its way.Bannon and Sessions both believe that Trump s rise is credited to his stance on immigration, however, the former reality show star told DREAMers recently to  rest easy  because his administration would not kick them out of the country. Just a few days ago, Trump said,  We love the DREAMers! Photo by Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images",News
 South Dakota Republican Rigs Upcoming Election For Herself By Personally Purging Democratic Voters,"This is a clear case of election-rigging.South Dakota Secretary of State Shantel Krebs is running for Congress in 2018. But rather than win the votes of the people fair and square, Krebs is using her current position to stack the odds in her favor.The Dakota Free Press pointed out that Krebs has purged thousands of voters from the rolls in the last threes months.The September 1, 2017, South Dakota voter registration tally shows 11,762 voters 2.14% of the August 1 total removed from Active status and 11,450 newly Inactive voters. This one-month purge restocks the Inactive pool, which the Secretary of State has whittled down over the last 18 months from a March 2016 peak of 54,708 to an August 2017 low of 30,619. Inactives now total 42,069 Thus, in three months, the Secretary of State managed to scrub 3.06% of the names on the voter rolls.Considering how close elections can be in this country, three percent is a big deal and could easily be enough to guarantee a victory for Krebs in November 2018.In fact, Democratic voters were targeted most by Krebs, which makes it all the more clear that she is rigging the election to help herself. In all, 2.63 percent of Democratic voters were purged from the rolls. If Democratic voters are kept from voting, her opponent doesn t stand a chance against her.And that s probably the whole point.This is voter suppression in its ugliest form. No candidate for office should have unfettered access to the voter rolls. As Secretary of State, Krebs is supposed to make sure elections are fair. But because she is going to be a congressional candidate in 2018, it appears she has thrown fairness out the window because winning is more important to her. When she pulls up the list of voters whom the state hasn t heard from for a while, it wouldn t be hard to sort that list by party and start with the Democrats first,  the Dakota Free Press noted.That means Krebs has a conflict of interest and she should be forced to resign.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News
 Trumpâ€™s Own Diversity Council Member Fact-Checks Him On DACA: â€˜Heâ€™s A Liarâ€™ (VIDEO),"Donald Trump s team is turning against him at record speed, and he s just been sent a strong message by a member of his own diversity council.Recently, Trump announced that he is going to get rid of the DACA program, marking his latest attack on immigrants. While much of America is furious over this, it seems like Trump has pissed off even his own team. Javier Palomarez, president of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and diversity council member to Trump, just destroyed Trump for recently claiming that he  loved  the 800,000+ people in the program. Palomarez pretty much tore Trump apart on CNN as he told Jim Acosta: If he gets rid of DACA, he s showing that he s a liar. He has said to this country that he is going to try to protect the people in the DACA program, that he was focused on getting rid of criminals. Palomarez made sure to point out the positives of DACA recipients, which includes high graduation and employment rates   far from the  drug dealers  and  rapists  labels that Trump had made up for immigrants during his 2016 presidential campaign. Palomarez even stated that he was so disgusted with Trump s announcement that he is considering resigning from Trump s diversity council. He said: I m gonna work right up until the bloody end to try to convince this president to do the right thing by these 800,000 Dreamers who reside in this country. Trump s policies and plans are disgusting even members of his own team. So far, any of Trump s staff have resigned over his inhumane ideas, and there aren t any signs of this pattern slowing down. Trump is a nightmare for any administration members that give a damn about human rights, and it s clear that many members are struggling with the lack of morale.

 Mother Of DACA Recipient Who Died Rescuing Flood Victims Refused Entry Into U.S. To Bury Her Son,"Donald Trump is set to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA, an Obama-era policy. It s a real d*ck move that is so appalling even Republicans are calling him out on it. Approximately 800,000 young people will be subject to immediate deportation, and that would have included Alonso Guillen, a 31-year-old disc jockey from Lufkin, Texas who gave his life while trying to rescue others in the state in the wake of Hurricane Harvey.On Wednesday, Guillen disappeared along with two of his friends after their boat hit the bridge over the creek and capsized, the Houston Chronicle reports.One of his friends clung to a tree and was eventually rescued but days later, Guillen and Tomas Carreon Jr. were still missing. Carreon s body was found floating down the creek on Friday.On Sunday, Guillen s body was found as it floated past a sandy berm. A relative quickly dove in and pulled his body to the shoulder of the creek. Soon after, a boat took him to shore.The Houston Chronicle reports:Guillen s father, Jesus Guillen, said he d asked his son not to try and rescue people in the storm, but he insisted, saying he wanted to help people. He cried and prayed on Sunday afternoon as they pulled his son s body from the water. Thank you, God,  he said,  for the time I had with him. Trump would have had Mr. Guillen deported and now Border agents are refusing to let his mother into the U.S. in order to bury her son.Guillen was a recipient of the DACA program and his father is here legally but his mother, Rita Ruiz de Guillen, 62, is still in the application process for legal status.Mrs. Guillen said from her home in Rita Ruiz, Mexico, across the border from Eagle Pass, that she s asking God for strength. I ve lost a great son, you have no idea,  she said while weeping softly on the other end of the phone.  I m asking God to give me strength. She explained that she had hoped that U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials would take pity and grant her a humanitarian visa so that she could go to Houston and bury her son, but she was turned back at the border. When we are with God, there are no borders,  she said.  Man made borders on this earth. To a man like Donald Trump, Alonso Guillen is one  bad hombre.  To anyone with a heart, he died a hero.Featured image via Christopher Furlong/Getty Images",News
" WATCH: CNN Majorly F*cks Up, Has White Supremacist Weigh In On DACA Panel","Donald Trump is the first authoritarian president we have ever had. Of course, one of the hallmarks of autocrats is that they destabilize trust in the free press and eventually attempt to squash the Fourth Estate altogether. Trump has done a remarkable job of implementing this dangerous autocratic strategy with his base. Therefore, it is absolutely vital that news outlets make sure that everything they do is on the up and up. This is especially true of outlets that are favorite targets of Trump s such as CNN.Unfortunately, it seems that CNN is dropping the ball there in a major way. Case in point   they had a white supremacist sit on a nationally televised panel about the debate over whether or not the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program   otherwise known as DACA   should be rescinded by the Trump Administration.On Monday s edition of its early show, CNN had a panel discussion regarding the program that protects hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who were brought here through no fault of their own by their parents and know no other home. On the panel were Democratic strategist Maria Cordona, and Dan Stein of the Foundation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). However, there was one particularly disturbing detail that CNN left out of Stein s introduction: That his organization has a long history of trafficking in white supremacy. Luckily for the sake of public information, Think Progress s Judd Legum did it for them. Legum writes: CNN did not mention FAIR s deep roots in white supremacy, eugenics, and white nationalism. The organization was founded by John Tanton, who founded FAIR to keep America  a majority-white population. Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center says of the founder of FAIR: [Tanton] has corresponded with Holocaust deniers, former Klan lawyers and the leading white nationalist thinkers of the era. He introduced key FAIR leaders to the president of the Pioneer Fund, a white supremacist group set up to encourage  race betterment,  at a 1997 meeting at a private club. He wrote a major funder to encourage her to read the work of a radical anti-Semitic professor   to  give you a new understanding of the Jewish outlook on life    and suggested that the entire FAIR board discuss the professor s theories on the Jews. Judd Legum goes on to say that Stein, said he believes America s immigration laws, which he regards as too permissive, are an effort  to retaliate against Anglo-Saxon dominance.  He said that the current generation of immigrants is engaged in  competitive breeding  and that  [m]any of them hate America, hate everything the United States stands for. As for Stein s contributions to the CNN panel on Monday morning? He insisted that DACA is nothing more than arbitrary amnesty program,  and said that Democrats should be forced to help the GOP secure the borders, build the wall, interior enforcement and cut chain migration  if they want to protect the DACA kids. In other words, make sure we keep America mostly white. No more brown people for this guy.Now, CNN has some great anchors. They really do. Personally, I try to tear myself away from MSNBC in order to watch them sometimes   particularly OutFront with Erin Burnett and The Lead with Jake Tapper. That being said, I have never been comfortable with their penchant for allowing Trump supporters to spew unchecked lies on the air. In this climate of deteriorating confidence in the Fourth Estate and confusion about what is and isn t true, these practices are hardly in the interest of the public good. Now, they have white supremacists as panelists, somehow believing that these views should be given mainstream legitimacy.Get your act together CNN. This is why I definitely prefer MSNBC.Watch this appalling discussion below:Featured image via video screen capture",News
 Hardcore Conservative Republican Senator BLASTS Trumpâ€™s Decision To Kill DACA,"Donald Trump s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA) is so toxic that even one of his most hardcore conservative Republican supporters in the Senate opposes it.It s safe to say that Oklahoma Senator James Lankford is one of Trump s most ardent supporters. After all, Lankford votes with Trump s position nearly 96 percent of the time, and he backed Trump during the 2016 Election.But Lankford is breaking with Trump when it comes to killing DACA.DACA was put in place by President Obama to help children who were brought to the United States by their parents. America is where they grew up and it is the only home they have ever really known. DACA was created to give them a path to citizenship and over 800,000 have applied.Deporting these people is heartless, especially since they would be deported to countries they have never really lived in.Trump s decision to end DACA has been criticized by Republicans and Democrats alike, and has drawn outrage from the American people. Trump s racist supporters, of course, support his decision.But some Republicans, like Lankford, oppose it. It is right for there to be consequences for those who intentionally entered this country illegally,  Lankford said in a statement.  However, we as Americans do not hold children legally accountable for the actions of their parents. We must confront the nation s out-of-date immigration policy and finally resolve the issues of strong border enforcement and merit immigration,  Lankford continued.  Policy reform must come from the American people through Congress. The Legislative and Executive Branch should put aside passivity and partisanship and finally modernize our immigration laws. That s nice, but if Lankford really supports DACA he will put his money where his mouth is and introduce a bill to enshrine it in law. Anything less would reveal his statement to be a lie designed to save his own ass from the wrath of voters who oppose Trump s decision.Trump intends to make an official announcement on Tuesday. Let s hope the outrage and opposition are enough to make him change his mind.Featured image via Ron Sachs   Pool/Getty Images",News
" Despicable Trump Announces An End To DACA, Will Kick 800,000 Kids Out","We always knew that Donald Trump was a heartless bastard. However, he just decided to leave no doubt about that fact in the minds of the American people, as the orange one has decided to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which is an Obama-era program that protects children who arrived in the United States illegally when they were very young from deportation. The announcement came late Sunday night, as millions of people waited anxiously to see what the fate of their family members and friends   and for DACA recipients, themselves   would be.According to Politico, Trump will phase the program out within six months, leaving 800,000 DACA recipients subject to immediate deportation. It seems that the six month waiting period to start deporting DACA recipients, also known as DREAMERS, is to give Congress time to solve the problem of undocumented children themselves. The argument seems to be that a lot of people in Trump s orbit believe that immigration policies like DACA are the job of lawmakers, not the president, and therefore President Obama had no right to do what he did for the DREAMERS.This all comes as many lawmakers   including many Republicans   have said that Trump should leave the DACA kids alone. After all, these are people who know no other home, who came here as very small children and are Americans in every way except on paper. They literally have nowhere to go if Trump and his goons deport them.Now, it should be noted that this is not an official announcement and that it came from White House sources with knowledge of the upcoming announcement who spoke to Politico reporters. Since Trump is impulsive and unpredictable, there is still time for all of this to change. Hopefully, Congress will do something during the six-month window, rendering this awful decision moot.Anyone who thought this administration wouldn t be on a mission to destroy the lives of millions of people was completely deluded. We now see that Team Trump is on their way to making America into their fever dream of a white ethnostate   or as close to it as they can come. That s what you get when dumb people decide it would be a great idea to have a racist run the country.Featured image via screen capture from Twitter",News
" Republican Panics On Live TV, Canâ€™t Say Trump Is Capable Of Handling North Korea (VIDEO)","Donald Trump s credibility and  power  has become such a joke that not even members of his own party have any faith in him to deal with the current issues that America is facing.On Sunday, Republican Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) unintentionally showed everyone just how little the GOP believes in Trump when he couldn t force himself to say that Trump could handle the current nuclear crisis the United States is facing with North Korea. In an interview with CNN s Dana Bash, Flake was put on the spot about how capable Trump is (and isn t). Bash asked Flake: Senator, there are a lot of people waking up this morning in this country very concerned about what they re hearing from North Korea. Do you share Clapper s concern, not just about North Korea, but with the president s ability to respond? Flake couldn t give a straight answer. He said: Well, I   I do have good confidence in our national security team and those who are advising the president. And the president does not have experience in this   in this kind of situation, but few presidents do when they come into office. And I m confident that the people around the president are giving him good advice, and I believe that he will follow it. I sure hope he does. Obviously, you like a leader that s measured and sober and consistent. Our allies want to hear that. I think our adversaries need to hear that. But we have got a good team around the president. Bash was quick to put Flake on the spot and point out that he hadn t actually said that Trump could handle this matter. Bash pressed,  Senator, you talked there about the president s team, but not about the president himself. Are you concerned about the president himself, as James Clapper is? Flake continued to stumble through this interview: Well, like I said, no president comes in prepared with regard to foreign policy experience. That s why you have a good team around them. I have had my concerns, I think everyone has, at some of the statements that have been made by the president with regard to NATO and other areas in foreign policy. Like I said, I think we   we want somebody who is   who is measured and sober and consistent and conservative in this regard. But he has a good team around him, and I have confidence in them. This is absolutely humiliating for Trump. Not only was his Defense Secretary, James Mattis, sent out earlier today to deliver a public statement on North Korea in his place, but now a member of his own party practically said Trump isn t capable of handling North Korea. Flake refused to support Trump and say he was a competent president, and instead opted to talk about the experts surrounding him.You can watch Flake humiliate Trump below:Featured image via screenshot",News
 Defense Secretary Mattis Speaks Over Incompetent Trumpâ€™s Threats To North Korea (VIDEO),"Earlier today, Donald Trump once again disgraced the United States by demonstrating his incompetence with empty threats to North Korea   via his Twitter account. Showcasing his inability to handle a crisis, Trump tweeted that he would meet with his military experts and could only say  we ll see  when he was asked about his plans to attack North Korea.Further proving that no one in his administration takes him seriously, Defense Secretary James Mattis was sent out to give a more powerful statement on North Korea, outshining his own boss  threats. In a statement, Mattis warned North Korea that the United States military would certainly respond to any threat. Mattis said: Any threat to the United States or its territories, including Guam, or our allies will be met with a massive military response, a response both effective and overwhelming. Mattis also urged North Korea to listen to the UN Security Council: All members unanimously agreed on the threat North Korea poses and they remain unanimous in their commitment to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. We are not looking to the total annihilation of a country, namely North Korea, but as I said we have many options to do so. Of course, the reason Mattis had to make this statement in the first place is because no one can believe a word that Trump says. Even eight months into his presidency, Trump has managed to destroy every ounce of credibility he might have had, and many of the tasks he should be doing are now falling on the shoulders of his more capable administration members. No one takes him seriously, so he needs to send others to make statements for him.You can watch Mattis cover for his boss in the video below:Defense Secretary James Mattis:  Any threat to the United States   will be met with a massive military response  https://t.co/7WzbWvGoIK  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 3, 2017Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News
 Trump Administration Is Already Talking About Withholding Harvey Aid,"On the National Day of Prayer, Donald Trump lashed out at South Korea and North Korea, while his administration wants Congress to attach aid for victims of Hurricane Harvey to a bill that would increase the federal debt limit. So, Trump is now at war with an influential group of House conservatives who have warned GOP leaders not to connect the two funding initiatives. This move might cause a looming conservative uprising. Usually, with Republicans, they want a debt limit increase tied to spending cuts but now, with an entire city underwater and thousands in shelters and at least 45 dead, Conservatives will have to battle it out.On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that he and the former reality show star believe that raising the U.S. debt limit, which Congress must do within the next few weeks in order to avoid defaulting on its bills, should be tied to disaster relief funding for Hurricane Harvey. Without raising the debt limit I m not comfortable that we d get the money we d need this month to Texas,  Mnuchin said on  Fox News Sunday. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin revealed the administration s approach Sunday morning when he was asked whether the White House could guarantee that funding for the disaster would not be attached to the fight over the debt ceiling. No, I can t. Quite the contrary,  Mnuchin said, adding,  The president and I believe that it should be tied to the Harvey funding.

Our first priority is to make sure that the state gets money, it is critical, and to do that we need to make sure we raise the debt limit,  he said.  Without raising the debt limit, I m not comfortable that we will get the money that we need this month to Texas to rebuild. In 2011, congressional Republicans brought the country to the brink of default after refusing to raise the debt ceiling unless Democrats agreed to a series of future spending cuts. And now, Conservatives and Republicans will have to slap fight each other in order to get aid to Texas.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News
" Trump â€˜Cherishedâ€™ Letter Obama Left Him When He Took Over, Then Did The Opposite Of What It Said","It has become customary for a president, upon leaving the office to the next holder of the title, to leave a note of encouragement. Different presidents, of course, have done it differently. Back in 1992, George H. W. Bush left Bill Clinton a note that famously said  I am rooting hard for you. Good luck.  Clinton likewise left one for the elder Bush s son, as George W. did for Barack Obama.But when Obama quietly folded his letter and placed it in a drawer in the Resolute Desk, it contained more than just platitudes and well wishes. In addition to being twice as long   Obama is a speaker, after all   it was filled with not only an account of how powerful a position it is, but also advice on how to handle the job with grace and humilityAlthough Trump has never publicly read the letter aloud, he has often spoken of how much he cherishes it, when he s not busy tweeting about what a horrible president Barack Obama was. Now CNN has obtained a copy of the letter from a person that Trump once showed it to:Exclusive: In the letter Obama left for Trump on Inauguration Day, he lays out four points of advice. Read it here: https://t.co/NLczJTxyaz pic.twitter.com/ttqXGx6TxK  CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 3, 2017Some highlights:It s up to us to do everything we can (to) build more ladders of success for every child and family that s willing to work hard.It s up to us, through action and example, to sustain the international order that s expanded steadily since the end of the Cold War, and upon which our own wealth and safety depend.[W]e are just temporary occupants of this office. That makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions   like rule of law, separation of powers, equal protection and civil liberties   that our forebears fought and bled for. Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics, it s up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.As you can see, President Obama left Trump with a lot of advice he has definitely not followed. From Trump s sustained focus on repealing his predecessor s signature health care bill to his determination to cut social spending in order to fund more tax cuts for the wealthy, he hasn t built any ladders of success. In his constant tweets threatening North Korea and belittling China, Mexico, and even allies like Australia and Germany, Trump hasn t done much for  international order. But on the last few points, Trump has failed spectacularly. He has zero respect for the rule of law or separation of powers, and has proven himself an enemy of equal protection and civil liberties.President Obama s letter couldn t have surfaced at a more perfect time to highlight the differences between the man we got used to seeing handle disasters, terrorism, tragedies, and diplomacy humbly and the man-child who scoffs now at even the most common social norms.If only it had been a set of rules.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News
 WATCH: Kellyanne Conwayâ€™s Latest Gushing About Trump Will Make America Vomit,"The wicked witch of the White House makes America sick again.As we all know, Donald Trump botched his first visit to Texas in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey by basically holding a rally and bragging about himself without once talking to a victim of the storm or surveying the devastation first-hand.And Trump s do-over trip was just as embarrassing and divisive as he praised the Coast Guard before attacking the media and bragging about his hand size.But Kellyanne Conway thinks all of that adds up to Trump uniting the country.During an appearance on Fox & Friends on Sunday, Conway gushed about Trump s visit to Texas and bragged about his pledge of $1 million to Harvey victims after Abby Huntsman incorrectly claimed that Trump s recent most recent trip has not been criticized by the media. That s what s so significant here, that the president and first lady felt compelled to donate $1 million of their own money, felt compelled to visit twice, to really spend the time yesterday, engage people, look them in the eye,  Conway said.The only reason why Trump visited a second time is because he f*cked up his first visit so badly. This is the Donald Trump that so many of us know and are privileged to work with and to know very close and personal,  Conway continued.And we all that s complete bullshit because Trump is a vindictive narcissist who only cares about himself. He has proved that time and time again.Furthermore, that $1 million pledge is merely a pledge. He actually hasn t donated a penny yet. And he probably won t since the foundation he uses to donate other people s money to charities is under investigation. Trump won t spend his own money to help those in need.But Conway wasn t done making America puke. She claimed that Trump is uniting the country by helping people who didn t vote for him as if to suggest that he doesn t have to help people who didn t support him in 2016. We look at them as our brothers and sisters in need who are suffering,  Conway said.  But this man is somebody who has always expressed the capacity and compassion for people in need. Is everyone done laughing yet? Because we all know Trump has zero compassion for anyone. He lacks the capacity to care about others. He only cares about himself and his image. Again, the only reason he went back to Texas a second time is because he refused to take the time to visit victims the first time around. Now he is busy using the victims as props so he can claim to give a damn.Conway then attacked the media for criticizing Trump, despite Huntsman claiming that there was no criticism of this second trip. They look so peevish and so small,  Conway said.  People are saying he missed an opportunity to unify the country. They are doing exactly that here. And also getting people   meeting their needs of food, water, and shelter at the same time. Let s unify as a country beginning with the president. Here s the video via YouTube. The relevant remarks begin at the 5:30 mark.Donald Trump did not unify the country by going to Texas.

 Trump STUPIDLY Attacks A Major U.S. Ally Before Threatening North Korea With War,"If Donald Trump drags us into war with North Korea, it could be without the help of our most important ally in the region.South Korea is a critical ally since the country sits just below North Korea. South Korea not only serves as a base for our troops and any strike we launch against Kim Jong-Uu, it would provide logistical and military support.Defeating North Korea requires strong allies and cooperation. But Trump may have just ruined that with a Twitter tantrum on Sunday morning.First, Trump took a shot at China. Then he tweeted out what amounts to an  I told you so  and accused South Korea of appeasing North Korea. Then he threatened war with North Korea.North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States ..  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2017..North Korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to China, which is trying to help but with little success.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2017South Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2017Trump s attack on South Korea comes just a day after he instructed his staff to prepare to withdraw from the South Korea trade deal, another move that antagonizes one of our closest allies at a time when we need them the most.So just to recap, China has warned Trump not to attack North Korea and now he has antagonized South Korea.America is running out of allies in Asia. And it s all because Donald Trump is a terrible leader who thinks being a bully works better than diplomacy and cooperation. Americans better get ready for nuclear war because Trump is going to start one.Featured image via Sean Rayford/Getty Images",News
 Trump Stops Praising Coast Guardâ€™s Harvey Efforts To Viciously Attack The Media (VIDEO),"Donald Trump has now become well known for his completely inappropriate tendency to disrespect those who should be honored. We ve seen it numerous times in Trump s efforts to congratulate and honor members of the military, and we witnessed it again earlier today.On Saturday, Trump visited Houston, Texas to assist a Hurricane Harvey relief effort. While he was there, Trump attacked the media several times   but the most notable one was the incident that happened at the expense of the Coast Guard.In speaking with military officials and first responders who were responsible for saving lives in Texas, Trump couldn t help himself from going after the free press. Trump congratulated the Coast Guard, right before uttering this disgusting attack while pointing directly at the cameras: I hear the Coast Guard saved almost 11,000 people by going into winds the media would not go into. They will not go into those winds unless it s a really good story, in which case they will. For someone who wants the media to be nicer to him and protect his fragile ego, Trump sure doesn t know how to behave himself. The hilarious thing about what Trump just said is that several members of the media did far more to help Harvey victims than Trump did. If he would turn off Fox News for a second and actually pay attention to real news, he would have known that several media figures were helping the Coast Guard and other first responders in their relief efforts. There have even been several documented instances in which reporters directly assisted Harvey victims WHILE they were working. But of course, we can t expect Trump to take the high road   ever. You can watch Trump disrespect the Coast Guard and the free press below:Pres.

 Trump Trolls Turn On GOP Moderates: â€˜Youâ€™re Gonna Get Primariedâ€™,"Believe or not,  moderates  do exist in the Republican Party. To those of us on the left, they hardly seem moderate, but they certainly aren t like, say, the Ted Cruz s of the world. In the House of Representatives, they even have a name. They call themselves the Tuesday Group. And since Donald Trump took office, it has been Republicans from that group who have been pushing back the hardest on Trump s more extreme and cruel policies. To that end, it should come as no surprise that Trump s band of trolls in his base are threatening the people in the Tuesday Group with primary challenges in 2018.At the top of the Trump trolls  list of targets is Tuesday Group co-chair Charlie Dent (R-PA). They re letting Rep. Dent know that his days are numbered in the most public of ways   by holding a huge event where they blasted their warnings to him from a park in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Adam Gingrich, who gives political advice to hard right politicians said to Dent: You re gonna get primaried. This particular rally is just the beginning. These people seem to be ready to primary anyone who has been critical of Trump and his agenda from the right. There s just one problem with that, though: They don t seem to understand some of these districts. In a place like Pennsylvania, Ted Cruz-style policies will not fly. These people have to be more moderate than say, members of the ultra conservative Freedom Caucus or they don t get elected and re-elected. There s that, and the fact that most of them seem to at least be attempting to appear reasonable. Despite these facts, though, word has leaked out that Trump himself went after Rep. Dent in a private rant, saying that Dent is destroying the Republican Party. So, as they are likely to do, the Trump Trolls came out in force on Friday in order to back their orange man up. Northampton County GOP Chairwoman Gloria  Lee  Snover said of Rep. Dent: I looked Charlie Dent in the eye and I saw the swamp. In times past, I ve supported Charlie Dent as the only alternative. But now, with his disregard and disrespect to my president   I will no longer be able to support Congressman Dent. For the first time, we finally are going to have primary challengers we can get behind. So, in other words, fall in lockstep with Trump or get out. Rep. Dent, to his credit, is pushing back, though. He says of the situation: I have repeatedly made it clear that on issues such as reforming the VA, making the regulatory environment more reasonable, improving America s infrastructure, providing necessary funding to help meet the needs of our military and spurring economic growth, I will work constructively and supportively with President Trump. At the same time. I am not a sycophant. If the president errs on issues that are important to the people of the 15th, or for the entire country, I will continue to state my opinions respectfully and civilly. The best part of this is that it could be a huge gift to Democrats. Pennsylvania is a swing state that, until 2016, always went blue. Therefore, the idea of a hard right conservative being elected there is pretty out there. We can t rule it out, of course, but if the GOP spends all of its times fighting with itself and the Democrats unify around one candidate, we win.Get it together, Democrats. Here are a whole bunch of seats we could possibly win simply because Trump Trolls can t abide a GOP lawmaker who isn t licking Trump s boots 24/7.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News
 Itâ€™s Become Obvious Trump Is Filming PR Video With Hurricane Shelter Visit (VIDEO),"One thing is for certain when it comes to Donald Trump s *presidency, he s failing miserably and his approval rating is reflecting exactly that. According to Gallup Daily, Trump s approval rating has plummeted to 34% with 61% of the country disapproving of the job Trump is doing.via GallupWhat better way to make himself at least look like he s doing a good job than to appear to be helping the people of Texas after Hurricane Harvey. Of course, he could just go and help, but it appears that he s brought along quite the press team and perhaps even a video production team to record his actions.Watch the video here:WATCH: President Trump loads a man s pickup truck with supplies in Houston https://t.co/GDf559LNXI  NBC News (@NBCNews) September 2, 2017Don t be surprised that if in the coming days we see a PR video come out on Trump s Twitter feed that will show all the  good work  Trump is doing for the people of Texas.

" Trump Brags About Hand Size While At Hurricane Shelter, And Itâ€™s Beyond Weird (VIDEO)","It s more than clear that Donald Trump is very proud of himself for visiting Texas for the second time after Hurricane Harvey. He s made sure to post videos of himself arriving, and the press is swarming him while he visits shelters housing displaced hurricane victims. Optics really are the best, right? Especially for plummeting approval ratings.However, in a very weird moment, the camera caught Trump talking about his hand size. That s right, Trump shouted: My hands are too big! Here s the video:Trump yells  my hands are too big! Not sure who he is talking to. pic.twitter.com/XpRsbRlhCc  Judd Legum (@JuddLegum) September 2, 2017Weird right? It s not really clear why he would say such a thing, or who he was saying it to. However, there he was, in the middle of a hurricane shelter, seemingly bragging about the size of his hands.If you re unaware, the size of Trump s hands has been an ongoing joke ever since the presidential race. The gag is that he has really tiny hands, or at least that s how rumor has it. So, overcompensating, he bragged about his hands then, and he s clearly still making sure people think his hands are plenty big enough for whatever it is he is doing at that shelter.Nonetheless, it s still weird and unnecessary to make sure he says such a thing on camera. He doth protest too much.Featured image via video screen capture",News

 Matt Damon Just Revealed A HUGE Secret About How Narcissistic Trump Really Is,"Donald Trump is an insane narcissist. We all know that. However, actor Matt Damon just revealed just how bad Trump s narcissism is   and it is positively frightening when it comes to such a person having the nuclear codes. As we re all well aware, Donald Trump owns bunches of gaudy buildings around the world. Since they are so unusual, it s only natural that they could be great locations for shooting movies. However, with Trump being Trump, there was a crazy catch that showed just how much of a narcissistic bully the orange man that is currently squatting in the Oval Office is.Apparently, in order to have access to Trump s buildings for the purpose of filming, directors were forced to allow Trump to have a part in whatever was being filmed. Damon says of this bizarre detail: The deal was that if you wanted to shoot in one of his buildings, you had to write him in a part. Martin Brest had to write something in  Scent of a Woman    and the whole crew was in on it. You have to waste an hour of your day with a bullshit shot: Donald Trump walks in and Al Pacino s like,  Hello, Mr. Trump!    you had to call him by name   and then he exits. You waste a little time so that you can get the permit, and then you can cut the scene out. But I guess in  Home Alone 2 they left it in. Damon went on to express dismay at the way Trump is running the nation and says of Special Counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation into the Russian hacking that took place in the 2016 election: [H]opefully his investigation is going smoothly. He can t wrap things up soon enough, as far as I m concerned. Damon also had quite a few things to say about Trump s white supremacist fan boys: [T]o see these young, aggrieved, white boys walking with their torches and screaming  Jews will not replace us!  It was just shocking. Then the night that the president [made his]  many sides  comment was absolutely abhorrent. Matt Damon is right on all accounts. It is shocking. Everything that is happening is shocking, and not in a good way. Donald Trump is destabilizing our democracy right before our very eyes, and the people in a position to do something about it will do nothing. Hopefully, Mueller finishes up soon, and we get rid of these people post haste.Featured image via Bill Pugliano/Getty Images",News
 Very Suspicious Smoke Is Billowing Out Of Closing Russian Consulate,"During an uncharacteristically blistering hot day, San Francisco residents noticed a surprising sight on Friday morning. There was smoke spewing out of the Russian Consulate that s scheduled to close and it s something Special Investigator Robert Mueller might want to look into.Temperatures on Friday barely escaped triple digits and it was a Spare the Air day in San Francisco, meaning that residents weren t allowed to burn their fireplaces (as if they d want to). Still, neighbors and the fire department were surprised to see black smoke coming from the chimney at the Russian Consulate.When the fire department arrived at the scene, they were turned away after allegedly being told that there wasn t a problem and that they were burning unidentified items in a fireplace.Mindy Talamadge, a spokeswoman from the San Francisco Fire Department, said the department received a call about the smoke and sent a crew to investigate but determined the smoke was coming from the chimney. They had a fire going in their fireplace,  she said.Talmadge said she did not know what they were burning on a day when normally cool San Francisco temperatures had already climbed to 95 degrees by noon. It was not unintentional. They were burning something in their fireplace,  she said.Source: SF ChronicleRemember, this is the consulate that Donald Trump ordered closed in retribution for Vladimir Putin s kicking diplomats out of Russia. Saturday is the deadline for the consulate to be closed.While the closure of the consulate and two diplomatic annexes might sound like a strong stance against Russia, it s a token measure, at best. Not a single diplomat is being kicked out of the country and the main consulate in Washington, D.C. will remain open.Saturday is the deadline for the oldest Russian consulate in the United States to close its doors. According to Russian propaganda Times, U.S. security services are set to search the facility on Saturday and it certainly appears that there s something in the San Francisco consulate that the Russians don t want Americans to find, or perhaps there s something that Trump doesn t want Americans to find.Update: Smoke was also seen outside the Russian consulate in Washington, D.C.EXCLUSIVE: Here's the fire in back of about to-be-closed DC Russia trade rep building. @janawinter on the scene. pic.twitter.com/oKoKX2OIBv  Foreign Policy (@ForeignPolicy) September 1, 2017 Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News
 Ex-DOJ Lawyer Just Dropped The Most Depressing Truth Bomb About The Trump Administration,"While most Americans are aware that Donald Trump has full intentions of undoing much of the country s progress and taking us backwards in history, it s an entirely different thing to hear it from a professional.Vanita Gupta, the former acting head of the Justice Department s civil rights division, had served under former POTUS Barack Obama and has made some very depressing remarks based on her experience with Obama s administration and Trump s. In an interview with the Washington Post, Gupta said she s been shocked by Trump s  anti-civil rights agenda : I have a severe case of whiplash, not just from being at the Justice Department, but also, quite honestly, from being a civil rights lawyer my whole life. I just have never seen an administration in my lifetime that has been so intent on pursuing an anti-civil rights agenda. That s a frightening remark to hear from a civil rights lawyer. The bigotry that has taken over the government under Trump isn t hard to miss, but a reminder like this does not make it easier to swallow. Fortunately, Gupta believes that Americans are the ones who will ultimately keep the country true to its values.Gupta is now championing The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and she says that even though the Trump administration is signaling a downward spiral for human rights, she has hope due to the resistance to Trump s attempts to destroy America s progress. She said: I am heartened by the level of energy that exists in communities around the country that are pushing back. I don t think any of us who believe in our country and in American ideals are gonna give up and kind of just throw our hands up and cower into a corner.

 Trumpâ€™s Involvement In Houston Chemical Plant Explosion Will Set Your Hair On Fire,"In the aftermath of the historic flooding that accompanied Hurricane Harvey s high winds and torrential rains, there was a surprising effect on the Arkema chemical plant east of Houston on Greens Bayou. The facility was inundated with so much water that it lost power, and that s when the chemical reactions began. When stored at improper temperatures, the organic peroxides at Arkema are unstable, leading to  popping  sounds, smoke, and eventually fire.Those fires emitted a smoke that many in the area described differently. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the emissions were like standing over a barbecue pit or something like that, where you get smoke in your eyes,  according to NBC News. Richard Rennard, a representative of Arkema, described what came from the plant a little more cautiously:[The emissions are] noxious, certainly. I don t know the composition of the smoke.A deputy was, in fact, taken to the hospital after inhaling the fumes coming from the plant.But after officials warned everyone in a nearly two-mile radius that more explosions could follow, questions about whether the plant was following proper safety protocols began to arise. That s when Arkema s connection to the Trump EPA came to light.The International Business Times got their hands on federal records that showed Arkema successfully lobbied EPA Chief Scott Pruitt and a number of Republicans in an effort to delay new safety regulations for chemical plants that were passed by the Obama administration. Those rules, crafted after the chemical plant disaster in West, Texas 200 miles from Houston, would have taken effect in March. They also would have directly affected Arkema.In their letter opposing the new regulations, Arkema used standard conservative trope: That the rules would  likely add significant new costs and burdens to the corporate audit process.  Those costs, of course, would be on top of the more than $90,000 in OSHA fines assessed to the Crosby Arkema plant this year alone, all for  serious  violations. But it was nonetheless Arkema s conclusion that  the final rule includes a litany of costly changes that have not been shown to increase safety. That seems a little less than true at this point.Although Texas Governor Greg Abbott has blocked public access to state records of just what chemicals are stored in which facilities, the AP reported that the Arkema plant also housed sulfur dioxide and methylpropen, which are, respectively, toxic and flammable. Storage of these chemicals would have required Arkema to file a risk management plan with the EPA   which would have triggered the new Obama-era rules.If Trump hadn t struck them down, that is.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News
" Texas Republican Rejects Canadian Offer Of Real Help For Hurricane Victims, Asks For Prayers Instead","This is why religion should stay out of government.The people of Houston, Texas are drowning as flooding continues in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.Death and destruction are everywhere, and people are desperate for any help that can be provided. People need food, shelter, clothing, and medical supplies.At this point, the people of Houston don t really care where the aid comes from as long as it comes.But Texas  Republican Secretary of State rejected an offer from Canada this week that would have provided blankets, beds, and physical manpower to the region affected by the storm.Quebec s Minister of International Relations Christine St-Pierre contacted Rolando Pablos to offer aid and condolences. It was a conversation about how devastating the situation is and we want to express our support to the people of Texas,  St-Pierre said.Had Pablos accepted Canada s help, many people in Texas could have had blankets, pillows, and perhaps even something more crucial. The manpower Canada offered would have come in the form of professional electricians who would have helped restore much needed power to residents and buildings such as hospitals and shelters. Our crews are well-equipped and they have good knowledge of the grid so they can help to restore and rebuild the distribution lines,  Hydro-Qu bec spokesperson Louis-Olivier Batty told CBC. Indeed, 250 Hydro-Quebec electricians did great work restoring power in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.Canada offered real help to storm victims. But Republicans slapped away their hand of friendship. Instead of accepting the generous offer of supplies and volunteers, Texas Republicans rejected the offer and asked for  prayers from the people of Quebec. That s right. Texas Republicans think prayers can help them more than actual supplies and manpower.What the people of Texas need right now are not prayers. They need blankets, beds, and electrical power, all of which are in short supply because God sent a f*cking hurricane to slam the Texas coast.The people of Texas should be outraged that their elected officials are not accepting help from Canada. This offer could mean the difference between life and death for many people. Prayer is not going to help. It s a nice thought, but it won t do any good. People can t get warm by wrapping themselves in prayer. Electrical lines won t magically fix themselves because of prayer.This is why Republicans are totally unfit to lead. They offer prayers instead of real solutions. And that is going to cause more deaths and suffering in Texas.Featured Image: Screenshot ",News
 Psycho Cop Drags Handcuffed Nurse From Hospital For Not Letting Him Violate Patientâ€™s Rights,"A power-tripping Salt Lake City cop was caught on video arresting a nurse for following hospital policy (and the law) by not allowing him to draw a blood sample from an unconscious patient without a warrant.In the video, Detective Jeff Payne can be seen confronting Alex Wubbels, an ER nurse, and then ultimately handcuffing her and dragging her out of the hospital.Payne was determined to get a blood sample from the patient, who had been involved in a car wreck that had taken the life of another driver. The only problem with this was that the patient was unconscious, so he there fore he could not give consent, and Payne didn t have a warrant.When Wubbels refused to allow Payne to draw the patient s blood, Payne argued with her and insisted that he indeed had the authority to take a blood sample without a warrant or the patient s consent. He also threatened to arrest her if she didn t allow him to violate the patient s rights. I either go away with blood in vials or body in tow,  Payne told the nurse.Wubbels consulted with multiple officials at University Hospital and then returned to tell Payne yet again that what if he wanted to take blood from an unconscious person, he would have to get a warrant.Payne, obviously furious, lost it at this point. He tells Wubbels that she is under arrest, grabs her arms and pulls them behind her back, then puts her in handcuffs. On the video, Payne can be seen dragging her out of the hospital and forcing her into the back of his police car. Help! Help! Somebody help me! Stop! Stop! I did nothing wrong!  Wubbels can be heard screaming.A University of Utah police officer and Department of Public Safety officers, who work as security officers for the hospital, were present but did not do anything to try to stop Payne from arresting the nurse for doing her job.After shoving Wubbels into the back of his car, Payne can be heard saying that from now on, when deciding which hospital patients will be transported to, he will keep this incident in mind. I ll bring them all the transients and take good patients elsewhere,  Payne said.Wubbels is being represented by Karra Porter, a Salt Lake City attorney, but she has not filed a lawsuit yet. According to Salt Lake police Sgt. Brandon Shearer, the department is conducting an internal investigation.According to Salt Lake police Sgt. Brandon Shearer, the department is conducting an internal investigation. Payne was suspended from the blood draw program but he still remains on duty. Shearer says that the department has conducted extra training as a result of this incident.Payne argued that  exigent circumstances and implied consent law  allowed him to draw blood from the unconscious patient. However, as Porter explained,  implied consent  hasn t been the law in the state of Utah since 2007 and in 2016 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against warrantless blood tests.Watch video of this out of control cop arresting a nurse for following the law, here: Featured image via video screen capture",News
" Fed Up With Congress, Trump Just Put A Big Nail In Obamacareâ€™s Coffin","Donald Trump and the Republican Congress may be failing miserably at their attempts to repeal and not replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), but that doesn t mean Trump isn t going to chip away at it, eventually dwindling it down to something that can be drowned in a bathtub.Trump took a big swing at Obamacare on Thursday by trying to keep the program secret from people who might be eligible to sign up. The White House is slashing the Affordable Care Act s advertising budget by a whopping 90 percent. They re also cutting the budget for in-person enrollment by 41 percent, so even if people do somehow get the message that they are eligible, good luck signing up. Altogether, that s a 72 percent cut in programs designed to boost enrollment, which is the only way the exchanges will survive.Administration officials cited  diminishing returns  from outreach activities. In a phone call with reporters, they said that most Americans already know about the Affordable Care Act. They plan to make the deepest cuts to the enrollment workers who have signed up few health law enrollees.Source: VoxIf Americans do know about the Affordable Care Act, they have a funny way of showing it. A recent survey found that a third of Americans didn t know that the Affordable Care Act and Obamacare were one and the same. Most concerning, given Thursday s cuts, is that those between the ages of 18 and 29 were among those least likely to know the difference. That s bad. The Affordable Care Act needs younger and healthy participants, or it will smother under its own weight. The surest way to kill the exchanges is to keep them a secret,  says Timothy Jost, a consumer advocate at the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.  Sick people will find them, but getting younger and healthier people enrolled is the problem. That is exactly Trump s point. He might not be able to kill the act through direct measures, but he can make it go broke. He already told us he would.3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 28, 2017This proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Trump doesn t give a crap about any of the American people, but that s no surprise.

 Another Trump Official Decides Itâ€™s A REALLY Good Time To Resign,"William C. Bradford, a Trump administration appointee who heads the Energy Department s Office of Indian Energy, resigned Thursday but claims that he was hacked after some of his controversial posts on social media were revealed. Saying  I was hacked  is 2017 s way of saying  I am a dumbass  and he really is the latter. Or perhaps he was drunkers when he allegedly made the comments.Bradford, who in 2015 resigned as a professor at West Point after penning an academic paper that argued the U.S. military should target Islamic holy sites as part of the war on terror, has just tendered his resignation with the Trump administration this afternoon and is no longer with the Department of Energy,  said DOE spokesperson Shaylyn Hynes, according to CNN.Bombing Islamic holy sites may have been a plus with Donald Trump, but this week evidence was revealed that Bradford made inflammatory comments through an account on the online commenting service Disqus. We supposed commenting on Disqus crossed the line.But he is playing the victim, because of course.In response to the story, Bradford told CNN s KFile that he couldn t comment  on an ongoing federal investigation into multiple cyber attacks and Internet crimes committed against me over the past several years, to include email intrusions, hacking, and impostors in social media. Bradford s alleged Disqus account questioned Obama s birth certificate and called the former president s mother  a fourth-rate p&*n actress and [email protected]!re. That sounds reminiscent of his boss s rhetoric about former President Barack Obama. Maybe Trump hacked his account.Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden sent letters to the FBI and the DOE on Wednesday to request more information about Bradford s claim that he was hacked. Who knows.It all follows a pattern of Bradford s, allegedly.In June, following his appointment to the Department of Energy, The Washington Post reported provocative comments Bradford made on Twitter   including calling Obama a Kenyan and saying that the World War II-era internment of Japanese-Americans was necessary. Bradford apologized for the comments at the time in a statement to the Post, calling them  inexcusable. Again, though, we think he sounds suspiciously like Donald Trump, the original Birther. But it s a really good time to leave the derailing Trump train.Featured image via David Becker/Stringer/Getty Images",News
 Trumpâ€™s Second Favorite Sheriff Just Very Suddenly Resigned,"Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke seems like he came right out of Donald Trump central casting. He s racist. He s so hard on alleged criminals that he even let some die in his jail cells. He is so committed to the idea of an Old West sheriff that he even wears a Stetson hat. Oh, and the icing on the cake is that Clarke is African-American, and to add a touch of bi-partisanship to Trump, Clarke is a Democrat (in all but words, deeds, and votes).He s a strong supporter of Donald Trump and he was allegedly under consideration for a cabinet position. Like Trump, Clarke is an authoritarian. While he s all for the militarization of law enforcement, his weapon of choice is old-fashioned intimidation and harassment, like he allegedly did toward an airline passenger who dared shake his head at the sheriff.Not surprisingly, Trump loves him, even though the whole job thing never panned out. Earlier in the week, Trump potentially violated ethics rules by tweeting a recommendation of Clarke s book.A great book by a great guy, highly recommended! https://t.co/3jbDDN8YmJ  Donald J.

Four people, including a baby, died in his jail cells within a one year period. One of the victims was mentally ill and he was deprived of water for a week. He died of dehydration.Despite being African-American, he seems to despise black people.Clarke, who grew up in a white neighborhood and attended a mostly white private high school, has said African Americans sell drugs  because they re uneducated, they re lazy, and they re morally bankrupt.  He calls Black Lives Matter  Black Lies Matter  and compared them to the KKK. He once claimed that  police brutality ended in the 1960s.  Clarke made an appearance in July at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where RNC delegates gave him a standing ovation as he proclaimed  Blue Lives Matter  and celebrated the acquittal of a Baltimore officer charged in the death of Freddie Gray.Source: Huffington PostGiven his history, I d say there s a better than even chance he s resigning in front of a looming scandal.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News
" Kellyanne Conway Immediately Regrets Defending Trump, Humiliates Herself On Live Television (VIDEO)","White House adviser Kellyanne Conway should have learned by now that whenever she tries to defend Donald Trump, she always ends up making a fool of herself instead.At this point in Trump s still budding presidency, it s become almost impossible to defend him. His approval rating is historically low and continues to plummet as he continues to f*ck up time and time again.Recently, Conway was made to regret her job as Trump s mouthpiece when she tried to argue that Trump was more approved of than the media. In an interview, Conway tried to beef up Trump s approval rating by dissing the media, and it went terribly wrong. Conway said: Why don t you throw up the mainstream numbers as well. Somebody can call me and let me know when the President s approval rating gets as low as the media s approval rating, and the Congress s and the party s. Conway must be just as ignorant as Trump because it s already been widely reported that far more voters (52 percent to be exact) prefer and trust the mainstream media over Trump. Only 37 percent would trust Trump over the media.Once again, Conway and her alternative facts have made America look like a joke. It s not just a stretch to say that Trump is more popular than the media   it s a flat out lie because he can t even come close. Trump and his administration are so dishonest that if the media wasn t doing its job, the American people would be left in the dark. Thanks to the Trump administration, fewer Americans than ever have trust and faith in their government and have turned to the free press for answers.Conway s defense of Trump only further proves that America is being led by an administration with no dignity whatsoever.

 The Guy Donald Trump Called â€˜My African-Americanâ€™ Thinks Trump Is Horrible For Black People,"In between defending white supremacists and pardoning a white supremacist, Donald Trump makes half hearted attempts at convincing the nation that he s not racist. In reality, he s only convincing his followers, most of whom presumably have  black friends  and  don t see race. Like his followers, Trump has a difficult time making a convincing case that he s not racist, even when he s trying. He famously tried during the presidential campaign, when at one rally, he pointed to a man, calling him  my African-American.  Of course, claiming ownership over another human being is always a really, really bad idea, but it s especially bad if you re trying to come across as woke, even by Trump s standards.What s worse, though, is that the man who Trump called  my African-American  wasn t even a Trump supporter, and nothing has changed, except for the fact that Greg Cheadle is now more convinced than ever that Trump is horrible for black people.Trump called Cheadle out by skin color at a rally in June of last year:WATCH:  Look at my African-American over here; look at him,  Donald Trump says while addressing man at Calif. rally.https://t.co/Gn8IL5XU1h  NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) June 3, 2016It didn t bother Cheadle, though:Cheadle later downplayed the exchange to NPR, saying during an interview,  I was not offended by it, because he had been speaking positively about black people prior to that statement. People around me were laughing [at the fact] that he noticed me, and everybody was happy. It was a jovial thing. He claimed, however, that he wasn t a Trump supporter and only went there to see what he was really like: I am not a Trump supporter. I went to go hear Donald Trump because I have an open mind,  he added.Source: NewsweekOf course the internet was skeptical that Cheadle wasn t really a Trump supporter, and it was right. Cheadle is a Republican and he ended up voting for Trump, but mostly because he didn t like Hillary.It appears now that Cheadle is regretting that vote. I would like for him just to show an interest in black people,  Cheadle said.  Why can t he go to a black city? Why can t he trumpet black business? Why can t he have more black people in his administration? He contended Trump s call for  law and order  is really  code language for,  We re going to arrest more black people. To put that in some perspective, he didn t think Obama did enough for black people either.Still, Cheadle hasn t completely turned on #45. He says his support is  on life support  after Trump s Charlotte comments. I m not sure what it might take for him to finally pull the plug.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images",News
 W.H. Admits Trump Lied: Never â€˜Witnessed Horror And Devastationâ€™ Caused By Harvey â€˜First Handâ€™,"Donald Trump claimed on Wednesday morning that he had  witnessed the horror and devastation  caused by Hurricane Harvey  first hand  during his visit to Texas earlier this week.After witnessing first hand the horror & devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey,my heart goes out even more so to the great people of Texas!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2017But just like everything out that comes out of Trump s mouth, this turned out to be just another one of his lies. When White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was questioned about Trump s remark, she admitted that he was full of sh*t. He met with a number of local officials who are eating, sleeping, breathing the Harvey disaster,  Sanders said.  He talked extensively with the governor, who certainly is right in the midst of every bit of this, as well as the mayors from several of the local towns that were hit hardest. And detailed briefing information throughout the day yesterday talking to a lot of the people on the ground   that certain is a firsthand account. In truth, Trump never went anywhere near the hardest hit areas and never even met with a single victim of the hurricane. He visited Corpus Christi and gave a press conference with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, where he climbed on top of a fire truck to brag about the crowd size because that s what he does.The reality is that the closest Trump got to  witnessing first hand the horror and devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey  was looking at a radar map.After witnessing first hand the horror & devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey, my heart goes out even more so to the great people of Texas!A post shared by President Donald J.

 Dan Rather: Muellerâ€™s Russia Investigation Has Trump â€˜Seized With Fearâ€™,"Legendary journalist Dan Rather says that Robert Mueller s ongoing Russia investigation has Donald Trump  seized with fear. Speaking to MSNBC on Wednesday, Rather explained that the investigation into Trump s possible collusion with Russia has Trump scared out of his mind. Donald Trump is afraid. He s trying to exude power and strength. He s afraid of something that Mueller and the prosecutors are going to find out. A political hurricane is out there at sea for him, we ll call it Hurricane Vladimir if you will, the whole Russian thing. It s still pretty far out at sea, but each day   this hurricane, this political hurricane   is building in intensity. Mueller s investigation has been steadily picking up steam. It was reported on Wednesday that New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is now working with Mueller to take an even deeper look at Trump s former campaign manager Paul Manafort.Former national security adviser Michael Flynn has also found himself under a microscope and has even tried to cut deals for immunity to flip on Trump. So far, neither Mueller nor Congress (who is conducting their own simultaneous investigation) has taken him up on the offer. This is presumably because they don t need to let Flynn off the hook in exchange for his testimony to nail Trump s hide to the wall.Publicly, Trump still claims that the investigation is nothing more than a  witch hunt.  However, those close to him say that behind closed doors, Trump has become increasingly distraught over the intensifying investigation into his shady Russian ties.Trump should be afraid, very afraid. In fact, being terrified of what Mueller may find is probably the smartest thing he has done so far. Sooner or later, the truth is going to come out just like it always does. And when that finally happens, Trump is going to be beyond screwed. It s only a matter of time.You can watch Rather s interview below: Featured image via video screen capture",News
" Enough About Texas, Letâ€™s Talk Taxes: Trumpâ€™s Priorities Shift To Breaks For The Rich","After a brief and almost meaningless visit to Texas, during which Donald Trump didn t meet with a single victim of Hurricane Harvey, the president s cavalcade moved on to Missouri, where he returned to what he really cares about: More money for wealthy people.He s first, of course. His tweets from Wednesday morning prove unequivocally that the only victim he cares about is himself. He sent out a placating message about  horror and devastation  (which he didn t ask even one Harvey refugee about) just 25 minutes after a tweet about North Korea, and only 15 minutes before he went back into Martyr Mode :After reading the false reporting and even ferocious anger in some dying magazines, it makes me wonder, WHY? All I want to do is #MAGA!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2017With that much obsession on his own well-being, why wouldn t the next logical step be another campaign-style stop to try and convince people to support his awful tax plan? Did I say campaign-style? What I mean is, this was not a White House event. This was straight-up partisan. If Donald Trump operated under the rule of law, the RNC would have to reimburse taxpayers for his Missouri speech, in which he explicitly called for the ouster of a Democratic senator, Claire McCaskill. Speaking to a crowd in Springfield, Trump said,We must lower our taxes and your senator, Claire McCaskill, she must do this for you, and if she doesn t, you have to vote her out of office.That s campaigning, not laying out policy. But he doesn t have much policy yet to reveal: The GOP has yet to agree on much of what will go into their  tax reform  package. Trump himself would like to see the  business  tax rate lowered to 15%, a number so low that it would cripple the government without slashing spending on the poor. But even most Republicans oppose so low a rate, and his plans for  tax relief for the middle class and repatriating offshore profits  are, so far, still out in the ether somewhere.The bottom line is, now that he s got that awful trip to Texas out of the way, Trump is on the warpath, and his only focus is now on winning. He even warned the members of his party not to disappoint him on taxes, the way they did on Trumpcare:I am fully committed to working with Congress to get this job done, and I don t want to be disappointed by Congress. Do you understand me?Oh, we understand, Donnie. You were embarrassed by Mitch McConnell and humiliated by John McCain, so now you want a McVictory to soothe your fiery case of butthurt. Americans see through your  tax reforms,  though. The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. It s the Republican Way!Featured image via Michael B. Thomas/Getty Images",News
 Trump â€˜Really Likesâ€™ The Idea Of A Violent Uprising When Heâ€™s Impeached,"According to Trump ally Alex Jones, when Donald Trump is impeached all bets are off. He won t tell his supporters to accept the decision of the American people. He won t urge calm. In fact, he quite enjoys the idea of a violent uprising in his name.Recently, TMZ approached Trump ally Roger Stone in an airport and asked about impeachment. This is not 1974,  Stone said.  People will not stand for [the impeachment of President Trump]. Any politician who votes for it would be endangering their own life. There will be violence on both sides. Stone clarified that a civil war  will happen  if The Donald is impeached. I was told the president really liked Roger Stone s clip on TMZ when they confronted him in an L.A. airport saying,  We re going to impeach Trump.'  Jones said during an interview with recently pardoned criminal Joe Arpaio after the former Maricopa County sheriff  said that  people who want to take me down better watch out. Trump has never exactly shied away from violence. In fact, when people oppose him at his rallies, he quite literally tells his meth-addled fascist followers to attack them. He has even offered to pay legal fees for supporters who brutally beat black men at his events.Unfortunately for Trump s supporters, a violent uprising will not go so well for them. While they view the Left as anti-gun, many of us are well-armed and (unlike them) properly trained to defend ourselves. We just don t worship our weapons like they do.Watch the interview below:Featured image via Gerry Images (Ralph Freso)",News
 Trump Confidante Confirms: The Donald Doesnâ€™t Want To Be President Anymore,"Donald Trump is a horrible president. Everyone knew in the run up to the election that he was in no way qualified for this job. Now that he is in the Oval Office, these facts are magnified on an hourly basis a thousandfold. However, there seems to be one unlikely person who, at least secretly, shares these opinions in part: Donald Trump himself.A source close to Trump says that he is miserable. For one thing, he is angry that members of his cabinet, such as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, are refusing to walk in lockstep on some of Trump s more controversial public statements   the comments after the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that left a woman dead is a particular source of Trump s ire. Further, what really seems to get him is that there will no firings of top level cabinet officials, because no qualified person would take those jobs now. The source says of how Trump is feeling on his cabinet secretaries  public thrashings: I think that cuts him to the quick. The same source says of the laughable idea of Trump being able to replace Tillerson or any other high level member of the cabinet: I couldn t name you a guy who would take the job or get confirmed. Also, the last of the alt-right   Trump s fellow travelers in bigotry   are pretty much gone from the White House, thanks to Trump s new Chief of Staff, General John Kelly. It seems that the disciplined adult in the room has zero intention of replacing literal Nazis like Trump s ousted Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon and key adviser Sebastion Gorka. The source says of these developments: General Kelly has come in and done a look-see on what everyone s been working on for the first six or seven months hereSome people were ready, and some people were not. As for Trump himself? Well, he s flippin  miserable. The source says of the poor old Donald s feelings as of late: He feels like this is not what he signed up for, and his accomplishments are being underplayed. He just looks around and says,  When is this going to get better? The source goes on to say that Trump s emotional state is  the worst it s ever been.  Well, what did he expect? Sure, when you re president, you re the most powerful person on earth. But it s also the hardest job in the world. It s hard even when the occupant is actually qualified. Trump is not. He has that attention span of a gnat on crystal meth, does not read books, can t even use basic modern technology such as email, has dangerous authoritarian instincts, no impulse control, and no respect for the rule of law. Further, he is bigoted, petulant, vindictive, and petty. He s also an admitted serial sexual assaulter and adulterer. In short   Trump is everything we DON T want in a president, from his character, to his knowledge (read: lack thereof), to his ignorance and bigotry.It seems that The Donald thought he d be able to rule over the nation like some kind of mad king. It s obvious that he got a very rude awakening. Oh, if only we lived in an alternate universe where he could have seen what this would be like, and had decided against running for president.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News
" Trump Just Threw A Colossal Hissy Fit On Twitter, Now He Looks More Incompetent Than Ever (TWEETS)","Donald Trump has the maturity of a toddler, and he certainly put it on full display early Wednesday morning.Completely ruining the tone he was trying to set after traveling to Texas with First Lady Melania to visit the devastation the area was left in after Hurricane Harvey, Trump decided to go back to his childish antics and reignite his ongoing feud with the media. Attacking  dying magazines , Trump said: After reading the false reporting and even ferocious anger in some dying magazines, it makes me wonder, WHY? All I want to do is #MAGA! Of course, let s for a second just ignore the fact that Trump loves painting himself as a victim, or the fact that several mainstream media networks are actually soaring and doing better than ever thanks to their anti-Trump reporting and coverage. It was the last line of Trump s ridiculous, whiny tweet where he stated  All I want to do is #MAGA  that gained the most attention   and the reactions were pretty damn hilarious. Here are just some of the best responses:   Apparently, Twitter users had a field day, as they often do whenever Trump displays how undeserving he is to be the leader of the free world. Trump never fails to humiliate America with his blatantly unprofessional behavior, and his Twitter account alone is a major source of anxiety and embarrassment for Americans throughout the country. As long as Trump has access to social media, he could humiliate or endanger the country at any moment and unfortunately, this behavior has become so common that we just expect this insanity from Trump on a daily basis now.Trump has done nothing to #MAGA, and shows no real genuine interest in improving the country beyond his own personal gain and that of his rich privileged friends.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News
 Hypocrite Ivanka Gets SKEWERED For Approving Dadâ€™s Move To Kill Obama Pay Equality Rules,"Ivanka Trump just proved that she doesn t support pay equality, and the Internet damned her to hell for her hypocrisy.During his presidency, President Obama issued a set of rules designed to help end pay discrimination on the basis of gender and race.The rules would have required employers to give pay data to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Such data would have been used as evidence of pay discrimination which could then be used to shape policies to end such practices.But Donald Trump killed those rules this week and excused his action by claiming that they violate the Paperwork Reduction Act. In short, Trump used a bullshit excuse to hurt women and minorities, and gave employers the power to discriminate at will.One would think that Ivanka Trump would be pissed about this, considering that she frequently claims to be a champion for equal pay. But, no.In fact, daddy s little girl actually backed her dad s decision. Ultimately, while I believe the intention was good and agree that pay transparency is important, the proposed policy would not yield the intended results,  Ivanka said.  We look forward to continuing to work with EEOC, OMB, Congress and all relevant stakeholders on robust policies aimed at eliminating the gender wage gap. Killing evidence-gathering rules actually kills the very transparency Trump claims is  important. Once again, Ivanka Trump proves that when it comes right down to it, she is a hypocrite and is complicit.Ivanka s betrayal of women and minorities drew a sharp rebuke from Twitter users.@IvankaTrump You re a sell out.

 Georgia Republican Threatens To â€˜Disappearâ€™ Democrat Over Monuments To Slavery,"A furious Georgia Republican issued a horrifying threat to a Democrat over her push to remove Confederate statues. In an ominous social media post, State Rep. Jason Spencer warned that if former state Rep. LaDawn Jones doesn t abandon her fight against monuments to slavery, she might  go missing. In a contentious back and forth on Facebook, Spencer told Jones that people in South Georgia are people of action, not drama  and then added that people who don t understand that  will go missing in the Okefenokee. Too many necks they are red around here,  he wrote.  Don t say I didn t warn you about  em. Jones, a black woman who represented an Atlanta-based district from 2012 to 2016, did not back down from Spencer s threat of physical violence. Enjoy but know   WINTER IS COMING,  Jones wrote back.  You know it too   otherwise you wouldn t have found a need to even make this post or those hollow threats of not coming to south GA. Spencer now swears that he really wasn t threatening Jones. Of course. No, to the contrary, he was just trying to keep her safe by giving a  warning to her of how people can behave about this issue.  (Insert eye roll here.) She is from Atlanta   and the rest of Georgia sees this issue very differently,  Spencer said.  Just trying to keep her safe if she decided to come down and raise hell about the memorial in the back yards of folks who will see this as an unwelcome aggression from the left. Jones later said in an interview that she and Spencer had developed a friendship during their time representing the people of Georgia and that she wasn t worried about his online threat. If it were anybody other than Jason Spencer, then I would be alarmed. But we had a unique relationship in the Georgia Legislature,  Jones said.  If that had come from anybody else, I d take it as a serious threat. But she did say that she was very concerned  by his appalling reaction to her efforts to remove the statues of people who fought against the U.S. in their quest to continue the practice of owning people based on skin color. Because if that s representative of what people in south Georgia think, then yikes. You can read the tense exchange in its entirety here:Featured image via screenshot",News
" A Judge Just Gave Sarah Palin Some Very, Very Bad News","Remember how Sarah Palin sued the New York Times for mistakenly saying that a concrete link had been established between her Facebook post that featured crosshairs over former Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords  district and Jared Loughner s decision to open fire on her? Well, that didn t work out so well. Don t retreat. RELOAD,  Palin famously posted on Facebook along with an image depicting gun sights over various states whose legislators she was  targeting.  Shortly after, Loughner shot Giffords in the head and pumped bullets into numerous others, killing six and wounding thirteen others.No concrete link between the two has been established   though it is reasonable to assume Palin s encouragement played a role in the shooting.Speaking of shooting, District Judge Jed Rakoff  shot down Palin s frivolous lawsuit against the Times on Tuesday. Nowhere is political journalism so free, so robust or, perhaps, so rowdy as in the United States,   Judge Rakoff wrote in his 26-page decision. But if political journalism is to achieve its constitutionally endorsed role of challenging the powerful, legal redress by a public figure must be limited to those cases where the public figure has a plausible factual basis for complaining that the mistake was made maliciously. What we have here is an editorial, written and rewritten rapidly in order to voice an opinion on an immediate event of importance, in which are included a few factual inaccuracies somewhat pertaining to Mrs. Palin that are very rapidly corrected,  Rakoff wrote. Negligence this may be; but defamation of a public figure it plainly is not. Judge Rakoff s opinion is an important reminder of the country s deep commitment to a free press and the important role that journalism plays in our democracy,  a spokeswoman for the Times said.  We regret the errors we made in the editorial. But we were pleased to see that the court acknowledged the importance of the prompt correction we made once we learned of the mistakes. This is, of course, bad news for Palin and her ally Donald Trump, who wants to  open up  libel laws to make it easier to people like Palin to file frivolous lawsuits against journalistic institutions for every little mistake even if a correction has been made.Lately, the Right has been practically masturbating over the idea of bullying anyone who reports something they don t like with expensive lawsuits as an attempt to keep criticism to a minimum.This is bad news for anyone who has recently filed a frivolous lawsuit against journalists, including  alt-Right  (a term employed by Nazis as a form of rebranding) journalist Cassandra Fairbanks, who sued a Fusion reporter for correctly reporting that she had made a hand gesture that had been adopted by the  white power  movement during a visit to the White House.Fortunately, Judge Rakoff  refused to allow Palin s farcical lawsuit to get off the ground. Hopefully, this sends a message to the Right that bullying journalists with lawsuits will not go well for them.Featured image via screengrab",News
 That Time Mike Pence Begged Congress Not To Fund Hurricane Katrina Relief (VIDEO),"Hurricane Harvey devastated Texas on the 12th anniversary of Katrina. And now, Hurricane Harvey is advancing to Louisiana. Katrina was one of the five deadliest storms in United States history, killing nearly 2,000 people as flood walls failed and the levee broke. A whopping 80 percent of New Orleans was under water as people fought to get on their rooftops to survive. Katrina was the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. since 1928 and it took days before bodies were discovered, mostly the elderly and disabled.In 2005, Mike Pence, then a Republican congressman from Indiana, who considers himself to be a devout Christian, addressed the issue of funding for the devastated state. Mr. Speaker Katrina breaks my heart. When I consider it s tragic aftermath the ancient parable comes to mind  and the rains descended and the flood came and the winds blew and beat against the house and it fell with a great crash.  For most American families when a tree falls on your house, you tend to the wounded, you rebuild and then you figure out how you re gonna pay for it,  Pence said. Later today Congress will continue the work of funding the relief and recovery from Hurricane Katrina,  he continued.  And well we should by speeding more than $50 billion dollars to FEMA & other agencies, but as we tend to the wounded, as we begin to rebuild, let us also do what every other American family would do in like circumstances, and expects this Congress to do. Let s figure out how we re gonna pay for it. Congress must ensure that a catastrophe of this nature, does not become a catastrophe of debt for our children & grandchildren,  he added, unfortunately.Watch:Video:  Katrina breaks my heart but we must not let Katrina break the bank for our children & grandchildren  Mike Pence-2005 #ImpeachTrump pic.twitter.com/SxmT8NGEA7  Scott Dworkin (@funder) August 29, 2017At the time, Pence was leading an effort by House Republicans to offset any post-Katrina aid with offsetting budget cuts in other programs, which includes highway projects and the new Medicare prescription drug benefit.Mike, you can stop calling yourself  pro-life  now, thankyouverymuch.Featured image via Aaron P.

" Sicko In Texas Wants To Make A Buck Off Harvey Disaster, And It Might Land Her In Hot Water","Late Monday night, CNN s Don Lemon had a phone guest who called in to the show from the apartment she was trapped in with her cousin and a one-month-old baby. Ices Bragg, in a pronounced southern drawl, described the scene around her: Rising water, fires visible from the window nearby, and perhaps most disturbing of all, an upstairs neighbor taking advantage of the situation.Lemon asked the woman to repeat what she had told him previously about the neighbor:Lemon: You told us last hour that one of your neighbors was trying to go upstairs to another apartment, and what happened?Bragg: Um, the lady had told her that if she had three hundred dollars to come in to her apartment, she would let her.Lemon: Wow. Unbelievable.Bragg: Yes sir, it is.The exchange was heart-stopping. We saw price-gouging on gas after Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, but watching big companies take advantage of desperate consumers is almost nothing new in this country. To hear an account of a neighbor, with the advantage of higher ground, threatening to let people die unless they pony up is nothing short of shocking.An economy based on unbridled capitalism like we see in America almost guarantees that there will be price-gouging in some areas during times of heightened demand for whatever someone s selling. But at the very least, there are laws prohibiting the practice during a state of emergency. That s little comfort to the poor, but it does mean that this upstairs neighbor could   no pun intended   pay a price.This is not the first report of price-gouging in the state. Houston is currently deluged with trillions of gallons of water. When those waters recede, the complaints that have been pouring in to the Texas Attorney General s office will likely result in serious trouble for those they hold to account.Watch the CNN clip here:Featured image via video screen capture",News
 Ted Cruz Awkwardly Explains Why Texas Should Have Federal Relief Money But Not Victims Of Hurricane Sandy,"U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz was against federal aid for natural disasters until he was for it. The Texas Senator voted against Federal funding for victims of Hurricane Sandy, the deadliest and most destructive hurricane in the Atlantic in 2012, but now he wants funds after Hurricane Harvey barreled down on his state. At least 14 people have died after Harvey hit Texas. More than 3,000 people have been rescued as responders work around the clock in devastating conditions.During a press conference on Monday, Cruz said that Trump has pledged  whatever the state needs  for water-soaked Texas. But, just after that presser, Cruz was in the awkward position of having to defend his position to MSNBC s Katy Tur on the 2012 Hurricane Sandy relief package, calling it  filled with unrelated pork. There is time for political sniping later,  Cruz said without one bit of irony or acknowledgement of his hypocrisy. It s not really political sniping, senator,  Tur shot back.  These are people who needed money and who needed funding right after that storm, I covered those people. Many of them, just like those in Houston, lost absolutely everything they owned. Cruz told Tur that hurricane relief is a  vital, central role  of the federal government and should continue to be for a long time. The problem with that particular bill is it became a $50 billion bill that was filled with unrelated pork,  Cruz said. Two-thirds of that bill had nothing to do with Sandy,  he continued.  And what I said then and still believe now is that it s not right for politicians to exploit a disaster and people who are hurting to pay for their own political wish list. Disaster relief needs to be focused on the victims of disaster relief, and I supported that for Sandy, disaster relief there, and I would support that anywhere there s a major disaster without getting distracted by political, unnecessary pork spending,  he added.The Washington Post begs to differ with Cruz:The Congressional Research Service issued a comprehensive report on the provisions, and it s clear that virtually all of it was related to the damage caused by Sandy. There may have been some pork in an earlier Senate version, but many of those items were removed before final passage. There were also some items that appear to have been misunderstood.Regardless, Ted Cruz voted against it but now he wants all that delicious disaster relief money for his state. And, Texas should get that money asap. The victims of Sandy should have, too.Image via screen capture. ",News
 ICE May Soon Be Able To Destroy Records Of Immigrant Detainee Sexual Abuse And Death,"Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known by the acronym ICE, have approached the National Archives and Record Administration (NARA), seeking an approval for their timetable in which they can destroy records in relation to their detention operations.NARA is an independent agency of the United States government whose main responsibility is preserving and documenting government and historical records, as well as increasing public access to documents of which the National Archives are comprised. On this particular occasion, however, ICE isn t asking NARA for advice about matters of record-keeping efficiency, but rather for approval to erase a long documented history of human rights and constitutional abuse.If Trump and his crew have their way, the sheer amount of immigrants in detention is going to increase exponentially, while the conditions of the locations where detainees are housed will get worse. So it is important that these records are kept available, but what exactly is the paper trail that ICE is trying to cover up?Many organizations and advocates have been decrying and trying to draw attention to the issue of abuse of basic human rights in the detention system for years and it turns out they have more than just a strong case. ICE has requested permission from NARA to routinely destroy official records from 11 different categories, mainly consisting of those that offer proof of the mistreatment endured by detainees, such as records related to sexual assaults, solitary confinement and, most importantly, the deaths of people in ICE custody. The other records ICE are campaigning to dispose of on a relatively frequent basis are regular detention monitoring reports, logs about detainees in ICE facilities and communications from the public reporting detention abuses.What is even more disturbing is it looks like NARA is going to approve ICE s request and their reasons for doing so are simply horrendous. Through the eyes of NARA, records relating to cases of sexual assault and even death of detainees do not document significant actions of Federal officials,  despite the fact that there have been 10 deaths in immigration detention in the past 10 months. When it comes to cases of sexual assault, Nara claims the  information is highly sensitive and does not warrant retention. If ICE gets their way, which is more than likely, their plan is to be able to destroy sexual assault and death records after 20 years and reports about solitary confinement after only three years, removing their criminal paper trail completely from the public eye over time.Featured image via Anthony Devlin/Getty Images",News
 The Exact Same Texas Lawmakers That Voted Against Hurricane Relief Are Now Begging For Help,"When Hurricane Sandy hit, affecting states all the way from North Carolina to New England and particularly devastating New York and New Jersey in 2012, Texas lawmakers overwhelmingly voted against recovery assistance. In fact, John Culberson, whose 7th congressional district includes parts of Houston, was the only Texas Republican in Congress in favor of the $50.7 billion relief effort.One of the loudest opponents of Sandy aid was Ted Cruz, who was merely weeks away from becoming a Texas Senator. Cruz s main concerns involved additional spending, which included funding for disaster preparedness and relief in other parts of the country as a means of gaining support for the Hurricane Sandy relief effort. Hurricane Sandy inflicted devastating damage on the East Coast, and Congress appropriately responded with hurricane relief,  Cruz said in a statement at the time in an effort to justify his stance. Unfortunately, cynical politicians in Washington could not resist loading up this relief bill with billions in new spending utterly unrelated to Sandy. Now Cruz, who campaigned for President of the United States, eventually losing the Republican primary in Indiana to Donald Trump in March of last year, has teamed up with fellow Texas Senator John Cornyn to contact President Trump, begging him to sign a major disaster declaration at the request of Texas Governor Greg Abbott, allowing the state to access key federal resources as soon as possible. Given the potential catastrophic impact that the Hurricane may have on Texas communities,  Cruz and Cornyn wrote in their plea to Trump,  we strongly support this request and urge you to provide any and all emergency protective measures available by a major disaster declaration. The irony of Cruz s appeal to the President hasn t been lost on residents on the east coast. MSNBC even quizzed Cruz yesterday on the hypocritical nature of his request, but in typical fashion, Cruz just avoided the question. There s time for political sniping later,  he said.  I think our focus needs to be on this crisis and this disaster. Despite Cruz abandoning them in their time of need five years ago, several New York and New Jersey lawmakers have decided to take the high road and support Cruz during his.Despite my TX colleagues refusal to support aid in #SouthJersey time of need, I will support emergency disaster $$ for those impacted  Frank LoBiondo (@RepLoBiondo) August 28, 2017Disasters & emergencies are just that disasters & emergencies. Must stand together as Americans, not be hypocritical based on geography  Frank LoBiondo (@RepLoBiondo) August 28, 2017Ted Cruz & Texas cohorts voted vs NY/NJ aid after Sandy but I'll vote 4 Harvey aid. NY wont abandon Texas. 1 bad turn doesnt deserve another  Rep. Pete King (@RepPeteKing) August 27, 2017As lifelong NYer w/ NY values I will vote for emergency Harvey $ for Ted Cruz's constituents. Above all, true Americans must stand together.  Rep. Pete King (@RepPeteKing) August 27, 2017Others were also quick to mention that maybe Cruz should also pursue the funding for disaster preparation that he was so opposed to when Sandy hit.texans should hope cruz helps do what he criticized the sandy aid package for doing: get $ for future texas storm prep. he won't, of course.  chris hooks (@cd_hooks) August 28, 2017Featured image via Michael Reynolds   Pool/Getty Images",News
" Even Back In 1993, Donald Trump Was Getting Shut Down With His Nazi Bullsh*t","In any other administration, this would be absolute gold. Every opposition player hopes to find some evidence of a politician acting like a complete jackass at some time in the past. They can use it in campaign ads, or even better, to keep someone from getting elected in the first place. That s not how it works with Donald Trump, though.Much like Greg Gianforte, the Montana congressman whose base turned out to elect him even better after he assaulted a reporter, Donald Trump was elected by people who wanted an asshole. After all, this is the man who famously claimed he could  stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn t lose voters.  His voters have never proved him wrong on that. He has consistently been just one of the worst humans ever to walk the planet in every way, and his base is still as fervent as the day they vaulted their racist, sexist, xenophobic, homophobic asshole into power.This video is not for them, though. This is just for us. They d probably claim this video is doctored, anyway.  FAKE NEWS,  they might say.It s not, of course.Two dozen years ago, Donald Trump The Plain Old Very Rich Citizen found himself in front of a House subcommittee on Resources. He was testifying that the mafia, with whom Trump has some experience, was all over the casinos that were supposed to be run by Native Americans. The man he s speaking directly to in this video is George Miller, an absolute powerhouse in Congress for four decades, consistently one of the most liberal members of the House of Representatives. In short, George Miller has no time for Trump s racist tirade.Is it foreshadowing?  Maybe we say politically correct, maybe we don t.  Trump was definitely showing shades of his racist father at that point, and a preview of just how little he cares for being a good person. But the way Miller shuts him down is legendary.Go ahead, watch it again. I won t tell anyone.Featured image via video screen capture",News
 The Nickname White House Aides Have For Ivanka Is Going To Seriously Piss Off America,"It was almost inevitable, really. We were bound to find out just how much better than us the Trumps think they are. After all, Donald himself hails from a long line of Trumps who have never had to work a day in their lives. Why would his own family be any different? And possibly the most spoiled of all is, of course, Ivanka, in whom Donald clearly sees all of the traits he thinks are good about himself.But there s no way to be prepared for the nickname that the president s aides have given her because it is absolutely maddening. According to a long-form piece in the upcoming October edition of Vanity Fair, West Wing advisers have taken to calling her  Princess Royal.  That s a name that came up during the G20 Summit when Trump gave her his seat at the conference table between England and China. The move angered even some insider fans of Trump, with one saying at the time,  This is not a royal family. They ve got that right. America was founded by people who believed in democracy, who wanted to get away from a king. Sure, we love to watch the British royal family   because it all seems like a fantasy. In fact, America s obsession with the Windsors mostly began with Princess Diana, the first in the royal house whose marriage did not include a vow to  obey  her husband.The unnamed advisers to Trump may call his daughter that behind her back, but there is little doubt that both she and her father see things that way. Her appointment to a position inside the White House was essentially a coronation, and the veins of nepotism that course through Trump s administration carry blood as blue as the states Trump lost last November.In the pages of the upcoming article, another anonymous member of the inner circle outlines the problem with Ivanka and even  Prince  Jared:What is off-putting about them is they do not grasp their essential irrelevance. They think they are special.Let s hope the House of Trump is short-lived.Featured image via Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Lord & Taylor",News
" GOP Runs Out Of Good Things To Say About Trump: â€˜Heâ€™s An Asshole, But Heâ€™s Our Assholeâ€™","Republicans have spent the past two years insisting that Donald Trump really isn t a complete and utter moron in addition to being a raging bigot.  Just give him a chance,  conservatives have bellowed from the rooftops since he was sworn into office in January. But now, it seems that Trump s own party has run out of good things to say about him.Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter was speaking during a gathering with the Riverside County Young Republicans when the best thing he could come up with to say about Trump was that he may indeed be an asshole, but hey, at least he s our asshole. He put his hand near his mouth like when you are going to whisper something,  Jose Guzman told the Los Angelos Times. And then he decided what the hell and told the room how he really feels. He s just like he is on TV,  Hunter reportedly said to the group.  He s an asshole, but he s our asshole. When this is the best thing your own party can manage to say about you, you know your  presidency  is in big trouble. To make it even more pathetic, this isn t even someone who has been against Trump in his past. This is one of his supporters. Hunter endorsed Trump early on in the primaries not long after he won the Nevada caucuses.Let s all hope that conservatives like Hunter are as willing to own the messes Trump has created for both the country and the Republican party. Because Hunter is right on both counts. Trump is an asshole and he is their asshole. Trump is most definitely a monster the GOP created and they need to own that as well. Then, once they get a grip on that reality, they need to grow a pair and do something to stop him before he causes any more damage than he already has.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News
 Thereâ€™s A Bill In The House That Would Completely Shut Down The Russia Investigation,"For Republicans, the Robert Mueller investigation into Donald Trump s Russian ties is a very inconvenient truth. If Trump is found guilty, there s little doubt that many others in the party would be dragged down with him. It s also putting a big damper on the Republican agenda to screw the poor and the middle class while giving big bonuses to Trump and those in his tax bracket (whatever that is). Now there s a bill in Congress to shut the whole thing down and it can be done, legally.Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) has introduced a bill that would financially starve the investigation by cutting off funding after six months and would limit its scope to nothing prior to June, 2015, which was when Trump decided to run for president.According to a Washington Post report, Trump has been seeking business opportunities in Russia for three decades. It began in 1987, when he explored the options of opening a hotel in Moscow. He found it rather inconvenient, because everything is owned by the government while Russia was under communist rule.Almost 10 years later, in 1996, Trump announced that he was going to invest $250 million in buildings in Moscow. Those deals didn t pan out, but he was given a lot of trademarks that year.In 2005, Trump further expressed interest in building in Moscow, saying,  It s ridiculous that I wouldn t be investing in Russia,  he said.  Russia is one of the hottest places in the world for investment.   We will be in Moscow at some point. In 2008, Donnie Jr. admitted that the Trumps have all kinds of money tied up in Russia. In terms of high-end product influx into the US,  he says,  Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets   We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia. In 2013, while planning the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow, Trump tweeted about Putin becoming his  best friend. Do you think Putin will be going to The Miss Universe Pageant in November in Moscow   if so, will he become my new best friend?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 19, 2013During that year, he also continued his talk about doing more business in Russia.Cutting the investigation off at 2015 isn t a guarantee that Trump will get away with it. There have been numerous meetings between Russian officials and Trump officials since then.Mueller, though, is going broad. He s going after money laundering and all of Trump s business ties and he s probably going back years. DeSantis sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Committee on the Judiciary. It s very possible that he has some insight into the scope of Mueller s investigation and he knows that if he prevents him from looking at anything pre-2015, Trump may have cleaned up his act, at least on paper.The provision, which is part of a government spending package may never see a vote, but if enough Republicans see this as a way out of the mess, it could.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News
" Trump Goes On Psychotic Mexico Rant During News Conference, Mexico Responds PERFECTLY (VIDEO)","Donald Trump s refusal to accept the fact that Mexico is not paying for his ridiculous, ineffective border wall is pretty much the definition of psychotic. Mexico has struck down Trump s claims that it will foot the bill for the wall numerous times, but Trump continues to state the opposite   and he continued to do so on Monday during a joint press conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinisto.When OANN s Trey Yingst asked Trump if he was still going to try and force Mexico to pay for the wall, Trump said: Yes, it will. One way or the other, Mexico s gonna pay for the wall. That s right. It may be through reimbursement, but one way or the other, Mexico will pay for the wall. Showing just how ineffective and flawed his plan was, Trump had to add the disclaimer that the U.S. will likely pay for the wall at first, to be later reimbursed (which probably won t happen). Trump said: We need the wall, it s imperative. We may fund it through the United States, but ultimately Mexico will pay for the wall. You can watch Trump completely disconnect from reality and facts below:Trump made these comments just hours after the Mexican government put out a strong statement about how it WOULD NOT pay for the border wall. Mexico s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: As the Mexican government has always stated, our country will not pay, under any circumstances, for a wall or physical barrier built on U.S. territory along the Mexican border. To make this even more embarrassing for Trump, former Mexican President Vicente Fox, a well-known critic of Trump and his wall, posted this on Twitter:.@realDonaldTrump how many times do we have to tell you? You can keep tweeting, but we won t pay the #FuckingWall. https://t.co/pfOwLSBocB  Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) August 28, 2017Trump seriously needs to get back to the real world and start working on real solutions instead of his twisted fantasies.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News
" Even As Trump Rips Their Country On Twitter, Mexico Offers Help With Hurricane Harvey","Just as they did during and in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina a dozen years ago, Mexico has extended a hand in friendship and assistance to the state of Texas to help them deal with Hurricane Harvey. Their generosity is especially moving in light of the horrible things our president has said about them, including insulting tweets as recently as Sunday:With Mexico being one of the highest crime Nations in the world, we must have THE WALL. Mexico will pay for it through reimbursement/other.  Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2017Mexico has, of course, repeatedly reiterated that it will not be paying for Donald Trump s multi-billion-dollar wall. The fact that a response is even merited still baffles me, because why in the world would they? But quite apart from their dealings with the U.S. President, Mexico has always had a good relationship with the state of Texas. The ties between the southern state and the country they used to be a part of have always been strong, due to the large mobile population that blurs the border between our two countries.Both Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray and Carlos Gonzalez Gutierrez, the Mexican consul general in Austin have contacted Texas Governor Greg Abbott s office to extend their offers of assistance. Gutierrez, in fact, has been  in constant communication with the governor s office,  according to the Dallas Morning News:As we have done in the past, Mexico stands with Texas in this difficult moment.The consul general in Dallas, Francisco de la Torre Galindo, echoed Gutierrez  sentiment:The offer for help and collaboration acknowledges a reality. We live in the same neighborhood called North America. We can t be distant neighbors, not any more, not ever.After extensive searching on social media and on the Office of the Governor s website, we can t seem to find any acknowledgment from Governor Abbott of Mexico s offers. That s disappointing, as Mexico has very publicly made them and their help is always welcome. As of Monday afternoon, however, there was nothing on Texas.Gov, Abbott s Facebook page, or either his personal Twitter account or his official account, the latter of which he uses extensively.On Texas  (and America s) behalf, let me say   Thank you Mexico, and thank you, President Pe a Nieto for your offer.

 The UNBELIEVABLE Reason Trump Pardoned Arpaio As Hurricane Harvey Was Bearing Down,"If Donald Trump hadn t proven himself to be the worst person to ever occupy the White House, he certainly proved it on Friday. While Hurricane Harvey was about to hit land as the largest hurricane in over a decade, he pardoned the racist sheriff Joe Arpaio.As it turns out, Trump s timing wasn t just heartless and it wasn t at all oblivious. Like nearly everything the former reality show star does, it was about television ratings. In the middle of a hurricane, even though it was a Friday evening, I assumed the ratings would be far higher than they would be normally,  Trump said during a press conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinist .  You know, the hurricane was just starting. He s done a great job for the people of Arizona, he s very strong on borders, very strong on illegal immigration,  Trump said about Arpaio.  I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly when they came down with their big decision to go get him right before the election voting started. Source: The HillBy pardoning the man who was convicted of disregarding a court order to stop racially profiling, Trump already proved himself to have zero compassion, but the fact that it was some sort of ratings grab proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Trump isn t even human.It also explains a lot about his media coverage during the election. Trump seems to have one skill, and that is to bring on ratings, in much the same way as any shock jock might. He doesn t elevate the national dialogue; he shoves it into the gutter. He will never be my president because he refuses to be my president. He is only the president to those who voted for him. He is by far the most divisive man (and I use that word very broadly) to ever hold office. He is id with a dangerous dose of ego and Friday s pardon of Arpaio showed the worst of both.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News
 Advisers Are Now Warning Donald Trump About Impeachment,"Donald Trump s so-called presidency is plagued with so many scandals it s hard to keep up. So naturally, impeachment is being floated around. The former reality show star and co-writer of  Art of the Deal , has unsurprisingly failed to make any deals after being on the job for 8 months now. Trump s approval ratings are abysmal as he finds himself to be the most unpopular president ever in the 70-year history of polling and then there are the investigations into his presidential campaign s possible ties to Russia.On top of that, White House advisers have reportedly been warning Trump about his potential removal from office, which entails the exhaustive impeachment process, according to Newsweek.Meanwhile, Trump is so worried that he s taken to his Twitter account to look for protection. It s very sad that Republicans, even some that were carried over the line on my back, do very little to protect their President,  Trump tweeted in late July.  If Republicans don t Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare, the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand! According to The Washington Post, several White House advisers have voiced their concerns to Trump about his possible impeachment, and about how overcoming such proceedings would require friendships with the elected officials responsible for making a decision as to whether he should remain in office, but instead, he seems to be at battle with them, including his Republican colleagues, who he has lashed out at repeatedly. If Democrats take the House in 2018, impeachment proceedings could begin. And as far as funding his ego-wall along the Southern border, well, that wouldn t even be a consideration in a Democratic controlled House.Trump s latest war has been with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, a man of influence in Washington, DC. Despite what we might think of McConnell, he s a powerful man. He could, ironically, make Trump a one-term President. Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images",News
 Trump Tried To Distance Himself From His â€˜Senior Advisorâ€™ Who Promised Russia Would Help Get Him Elected,"Remember the name Felix Sater, because it s going to come up a lot while Robert Mueller and his special counsel team tear down the fa ade surrounding Donald Trump s collusion with the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.According to the New York Times, Mr. Sater, a former broker for the Trump Organization, wrote a series of emails that played up his ties to both Trump himself and to Vladimir Putin and the Russian government. Those emails were sent to Michael Cohen, Mr. Trump s lawyer. In the communications, Sater said that if the company built a Trump Tower in Moscow, he would personally get Putin on board and, more importantly, that it would help them engineer Donald Trump s election as President of the United States:I will get Putin on this program and we will get Donald elected. We both know no one else knows how to pull this off without stupidity or greed getting in the way. I know how to play it and we will get this done. Buddy, our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it. I will get all of Putins team to buy in on this, I will manage this process.That s quite a boast, coming from a man who by the time he even worked for Trump had already  worked as a mob informant for the U.S. government, fled to Moscow to avoid criminal charges while boasting of his KGB and Kremlin contacts there, and had gone to prison for slashing apart another man s face with a broken cocktail glass,  according to Bloomberg.At another point, Sater promised to arrange for Ivanka Trump to  sit in Putin s chair.  Felix later escorted Donald s kids around Moscow, though Ivanka now says she had nothing to do with any business dealings.Trump insists he barely knows Felix Sater, and has for some time. But Sater, post-prison, carried a Trump Organization business card describing himself as a  senior advisor  to the future president. One might imagine that litigation-happy Trump would have fits if he saw an unauthorized person toting this around:Sater's business card pic.twitter.com/6AOZcb7QHd  Kerry McCue (@krrmcc) May 13, 2017Does all that sound a little too James Bond-ish for you?

 Donald Trump Was Looking To Build A Trump Tower In Moscow While He Was Running For President,"As you would be more than aware, contacts between high-ranking and lower-level Trump aides and Russians have emerged in recent months and, as a result of these talks, a new story is coming to light; that Donald Trump s businesses were trying to seal a deal on building an enormous Trump Tower in Moscow while he was campaigning to become President of the United States.According to those familiar with the proposal, as well as new records reviewed by Trump Organization lawyers, Felix Sater, a Russian-born real estate developer who migrated to Brooklyn at the age of six, was essentially begging Trump to fly to Russia to promote the idea for the Tower and also claimed he could get President Vladimir Putin to say  great things  about Trump, all while he was still campaigning to be Commander in Chief in late 2015 and early 2016.Sater took it to another level when he predicted in an email sent to Trump Organization Executive Vice President Michael Cohen in November 2015, that Trump and his organization would be celebrating both his Presidential win and one of the biggest residential projects in the history of real estate. According to one of the few people briefed on the email exchange, Sater s message to Cohen was something to the effect of,  Can you believe two guys from Brooklyn are going to elect a president? The plan for the Moscow Trump Tower was abandoned at the end of January last year, just before the beginning of the presidential primaries and before Trump s Russian business ties became a major issue, because, although the Trump Organization signed a letter of intent to go ahead with the project despite Trump himself not making the proposed trip to Russia, they lacked the land permits to proceed.The details of the Moscow Trump Tower have deal have never been made public, however, the emails are scheduled to be turned over to congressional investigators soon and all signs point to this being far from President Trump s only business dealing with Russia during his time on the campaign trail. White House officials, as well as Cohen, Trump s longtime legal advisor, have declined to comment on the issue.Featured image via Michael Reynolds   Pool/Getty Images",News
 Eric Holder Just Hilariously Called Trump Out On Arpaio: Obama Never Asked Me To Drop A Case,"Former Attorney General Eric Holder responded to a report that Donald Trump asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to drop the charges against Joe Arpaio (aka America s most racist sheriff) by throwing shade at the crooked administration on Twitter.The Washington Post published an article on Saturday claiming that Trump had personally asked Sessions to abandon the case against Arpaio, who was convicted of criminal contempt charges after ignoring a federal court order. Holder tweeted out that in all the years he had worked as Attorney General under former President Obama, he had never once been asked to drop charges against anybody, ever. Number of times over six years that President Obama called and asked me to think about dropping a case: ZERO,  Holder tweeted on Sunday, with a link to the article written by the Post included.Number of times over six years that President Obama called and asked me to think about dropping a case: ZERO https://t.co/je7dhk7R28  Eric Holder (@EricHolder) August 27, 2017According to the Post, Trump s advisers told him that asking Sessions to drop the Arpaio case would be a mistake but naturally, he did it anyway. When the charges against Arpaio moved forward, Trump decided that it didn t matter because he was just going to pardon him if he was convicted anyway. What are friends for? Right?Arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt charges after a federal court ordered him to stop the racist policing practices he employed as sheriff of Maricopa County, which included jailing suspected illegal immigrants in a  tent city.  Despite the court s ruling that his practices were discriminatory and violated the Constitution, Arpaio basically gave a middle finger to the judge and continued his bigoted tactics.Trump pardoned his loyal supporter on Friday night while the nation was being ravaged by Hurricane Harvey.

 Phoenix Newspaper Breaks The Internet In Brutal Tweetstorm On Former Sheriff Joe Arpaio,"A Phoenix publication took to its Twitter account to explain the kind of person former Sheriff Joe Arpaio is following Donald Trump s decision to pardon him. The former reality show star pardoned the racist former Sheriff of Maricopa County while a hurricane was barreling down on Texas. Trump is likely testing his pardoning powers to use that same privilege for the Russia investigation.Joe Arpaio called himself  America s toughest sheriff,  but appeared to be begging for a pardon after he was convicted of criminal contempt in July after violating a 2011 court order in a racial profiling case.

 WaPo: Trump Tried To Get Sessions To Let Racist Sheriff Joe Arpaio Off The Hook Months Ago,"Donald Trump just threw a match on this tinder box of a nation when he decided to pardon former Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio. This guy is a racist who was convicted in court of contempt for refusing to follow an order to stop racially profiling and detaining people. Arpaio terrorized that county for years with impunity and without consequence, and now it seems that he will be able to carry on being awful.Now, there is even more nefarious news out there regarding this. It seems that Trump tried to get Jeff Sessions  Department of Justice to let Arpaio off the hook by dropping the case against him altogether. It seems that Sessions told Trump that such an action would not be the appropriate thing to do. Having no other choice, Trump waited until Arpaio was convicted, and THEN decided to wait for the perfect time to issue a pardon. One White House official says of Trump s thinking on the Arpaio matter: We knew the president wanted to do this for some time now and had worked to prepare for whenever the moment may come. Of course, we mustn t forget that Arpaio and Trump have been political partners in crime ever since they started the birtherism nonsense, in which they promoted the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States. They both doggedly tried to prove that the nation s first Black President was not a legitimate Commander-in-Chief   all because he s Black.In short, they are two racist peas in a pod, so of course Trump wasn t going to let his man go to jail, even though if there was ever someone who deserves to rot in jail, it s this racist, abusive former Sheriff.One good thing came out of this, though: It showed that when Trump is willing to do something truly egregious, the Department of Justice has maintained at least a little independence and is willing to push back. However, in this instance, said pushback had no real effect.Come on, Congress, Mueller, whomever   please get rid of this lawless president while we still have a nation left.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images",News
" Trump Calls Out Anti-Fascists By Name, But FBI And DHS Say The Alt-Right Acts Like ISIS â€” And Goes Unmentioned","Ever since the Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia claimed the life of Heather Heyer, the entire spectrum on the Right   from moderates all the way to Alt-Right terrorists   has been scrambling to figure out a way to blame it on the Left. That s natural. It was a murder, after all. Nobody wants to take the blame for anything bad they re responsible for, let alone the murder of an innocent victim. But Donald Trump has been especially adept at seemingly calling out radical groups, while never actually explicitly naming the radical group that is to blame.It s not like he doesn t know the phrase  Alt-Right.  It s in the news every day. He sure as hell knows the word  Antifa.  That s the  many  in his  many sides  comment after Heyer s murder, which he doubled down on two days later. In fact, the word came out of his mouth in accusation at his Phoenix rally last Tuesday. Someone even made a joke about it: pic.twitter.com/9fANLcaXXN  Chris Stephens (@ChrisStephensMD) August 23, 2017The only time I can remember Trump saying the words  alt-right  in reference to Charlottesville was in Trump Tower: What about the  alt-left  that came charging at, as you say, the  alt-right ? Do they have any semblance of guilt? As YOU say.So why won t he address the Alt-Right? They are a terrorist group, by any definition. What s more, they identify as Christians, persecuted for their identity, justifying their actions with appeals to  us  over  them.  That s pretty reminiscent of another radicalized, religious extremist group that feels persecuted, hates outsiders and gay people, treats women like chattel, and uses terror and death to achieve their aims.Only those guys are brown.Here in America, though, ISIS and groups like them   that is to say,  radical Islamic terrorists    have nothing on white Christian males. A joint intelligence bulletin from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security found that the group we softly label  white supremacists  were responsible for 49 murders in 26 terror attacks over the last decade and a half. That s more than any other group in America. That report from two agencies tasked with American safety literally says that radicalized white Christian males are the most dangerous people in the country.Part of Trump s unwillingness to name the Alt-Right as the terror group they are comes from their Goebbels-like effectiveness with propaganda. If they can make it seem like there actually are two  sides  to the conflict that led to Heyer s death (and countless other injuries, physical, mental, and personal), they can paint their own side as justified in opposition to it. They achieve this with troll-led petitions that seem legitimate, and by posing as members of the Left and doing horrible things. Remember that kid who would break something, then leave a piece of it in his brother s room so his parents would bust the wrong boy? That s the Alt-Right.But the other part of Donald Trump s inability to name names when it comes to the Alt-Right is simple: They are his biggest fans, and he loves them, terrorism be damned.Featured image via Stephen Maturen/Getty Images",News
 Disgusting Trump Is Using Hurricane As An Opportunity To Deport People,"A Category Four hurricane has hit Texas. It s set to be the most disastrous hurricane since Katrina hit Louisiana in 2005, yet Donald Trump is using it as an opportunity to deport people.Thousands of people are evacuating the affected areas, trying to beat the storm. Instead of helping ensure that evacuations go smoothly, the Trump administration is doing the exact opposite. They are creating checkpoints and forcing people to show their  papers  proving they are documented residents of the United States.The federal government is closing border patrol checkpoints in the path of the hurricane, but they re leaving checkpoints open outside the path. The Texas Tribune reports: Border Patrol checkpoints will not be closed unless there is a danger to the safety of the traveling public and our agents. Border Patrol resources, including personnel and transportation, will be deployed on an as needed basis to augment the efforts and capabilities of local-response authorities,  the agency said in a statement.The Border Patrol is a law enforcement agency and we will not abandon our law enforcement duties. I m sure you can imagine the consequences. Sure, checkpoints will only be open outside the path of the hurricane, but they can still cause traffic to back up for miles. It will also all but ensure that undocumented immigrants and their families will stay behind, only to be potentially killed by the hurricane or the resulting floods.Civil rights agencies like the ACLU are furious. This is a disgusting move from the Border Patrol that breaks with past practices,  American Civil Liberties Union director of immigration policy and campaigns Lorella Praeli said.  The Border Patrol should never keep checkpoints open during any natural disasters in the United States. Everyone, no matter the color of their skin or background, is worth saving. Everyone, no matter the color of their skin or background, is worth saving.  Except to Donald Trump, they really aren t. Trump doesn t care about anyone, but he does care about appeasing his racist, xenophobic base. John Edwards used to talk about two Americas. Today, we have the America that Donald Trump cares about (about 1/3 of the country) and we have the rest of us who could all die in the path of a hurricane for all he cares.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images.

" One More Nazi Resigned From Trumpâ€™s White, House; Will Newly Pardoned Arpaio Replace Him?","Just days after Donald Trump advisor and avowed racist alt-right provocateur Steve Bannon was fired, another of Trump s White House Nazis is out.Sebastian Gorka was born in London but lived in Hungary where he worked with racist and anti-semitic groups. He resigned on Friday because Trump apparently hasn t been effective enough in Making America Great White Again. [G]iven recent events, it is clear to me that forces that do not support the MAGA promise are   for now   ascendant within the White House,  Gorka reportedly wrote in a letter obtained by The Federalist. CNN confirmed the letter. As a result, the best and most effective way I can support you, Mr. President, is from outside the People s House,  he continued. Gorka was seen as one of Trump s staunchest supporters, and often took to TV to rip the media s coverage of the administration.Source: The HillGorka is best known as one of Trump s spokespeople who creeps the hell out of people. Watch Samantha Bee tell you everything you need to know:Donald Trump s White House has had quite the day. He banned transgender people from the military. A Category Four hurricane is about to hit Texas, so Trump loosened regulations on federal flooding standards.In a week when Trump is challenged to prove to the nation that he s not racist, he pardoned Maricopa, Arizona former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted of violating a court order to stop racially profiling people. Will Arpaio take Gorka s place?Why not? Trump clearly doesn t care if he s perceived as a racist. That s his base. In his surreal and overly defensive speech he gave in Phoenix this week, he once again brought up the border wall, an issue that Arpaio deeply cares about. Arpaio has long been a supporter of Trump and he s proven that he s willing to thwart the law, just like Trump.Trump and Arpaio aren t new to partnering. Arpaio assigned a fake posse to help in Trump s fake search for President Obama s real birth certificate.Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio would assign a five-man  Cold Case Posse  to probe the authenticity of Obama s birth certificate, he told Jerome Corsi, the former World Net Daily columnist and Ur-birther.  When I get allegations brought to me by the citizens of Maricopa County, I look into the allegations, just like I am doing here,  he said at the time.Six months later, Arpaio announced at a press conference that the long-form birth certificate was a  computer-generated forgery.  That s when Trump took notice. Within a couple weeks of Arpaio s announcement, Trump had printed out an Associated Press article about the charade and handwritten a note to the sheriff. It read:Joe Great going you are the only one with the guts to do this keep up the good fight. Donald TrumpSource: NY MagIn other words, look for Arpaio to be Trump s next hire. Perhaps Homeland Security, or like Gorka, terrorism advisor?Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News
" BREAKING: Trump Goes Full Racist AGAIN, Pardons Sheriff Joe Arpaio","Donald Trump has an endless history of racism that dates back decades, so it comes as no surprise that he has now pardoned the very bigoted and controversial former Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio. This is a man who was convicted of being a bigot and using the law and the powers of his office to racially profile and brutalize Latino citizens. He was found in criminal and civil contempt of court, but of course, since he was targeting Latinos, who Trump hates, that is just A-Okay with the orange fascist.Generally, when people receive pardons, they have served some time, and shown some remorse. This is nothing more than an extension of Trump s open and visible contempt for non-white immigrants and those from Mexico in particular   and all minorities, really   this comes as no surprise, reprehensible as it is.Also, to top it all off, Sheriff Joe is a birther, and he constantly went to the press to dispute the validity of President Obama s birth certificate in explicitly racist terms. This, of course, was Trump s number one crusade in his original foray into presidential politics, and it was a huge factor in his gaining real traction with the racist Republican base voters.Of course, we cannot forget the infamous  tent city  in which imprisoned immigrants were housed in tents and forced to be humiliated with pink underwear. It goes on and on.This is disgusting. A racist who was found to have used the power of his elected office to enact racism as policy is now going free because the guy squatting in the Oval Office is a racist, too.All I can say is that at least the people of Maricopa County voted him out after all of these years and all of this open bigotry as policy.If there isn t GOP backlash from this, we need to all rise up. This is beyond appalling. With this pardon, racism is officially law in America.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images",News
" On The Day A Hurricane Is About To Hit Land, Trump Signs Order Making Floods Worse","Donald Trump is about to get his first real test as Commander-in-Chief. Hurricane Harvey is a Category four storm that s about to hit landfall in Texas. It will be the worst since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and on the very same day it s set to hit he s going to sign an executive order that will potentially make future hurricane damage much worse.Trump s executive order is just another petulant attempt at undoing everything Obama did because well he was Obama. It would reverse standards that would make government buildings safer from flooding   something needed with rising sea levels, and yes, with hurricanes.The Trump administration has complained that it takes too much time to get permits and approvals for construction projects. The administration has issued dozens of rules and orders to reverse or rescind Obama-era regulations addressing climate change and its consequences such as rising sea levels and more severe storms.The Obama-era standard required that builders factor in scientific projections for how climate change could affect flooding in a certain area and ensure projects can withstand rising sea levels and stronger downpours.Source: CNBCThe scientific consensus is that sea levels are going to rise at an alarming level. By the end of the century, they could rise by more than six feet. While that may not sound like a lot, think about the havoc on your own home when there are just a few inches of flood water.Obviously, this executive order only affects federal buildings and state regulations could easily override them, but many of the states in the flood zones (like Texas, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida) are led by, and overwhelmingly inhabited by, Republican climate change deniers. Washington, D.C. is also in a flood zone.Trump sees safety regulations on buildings as an inconvenience for him. Overturning Obama s executive order does two things, it helps erase the black guy s legacy and it helps the Grifter-in-Chief just in case he gets a federal contract.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images.",News
 RNC Staffer Assigned To Finding Positive Stories About Trump Says Take This Job And Shove It,"Imagine for a moment that your job was to scour the media, searching for the rare news report that puts a positive spin on Donald Trump and his disastrous escapades in the White House. For one RNC staffer, this was the day to day reality he faced every morning when he clocked into work. After hanging on for several months, Andy Hemming finally decided he couldn t take it any longer and resigned. You can hardly blame the guy and have to ask, how did he stay on this sinking ship as long as he did?According to Politico, Hemming handed in his resignation on Monday. Previously, the publication had written a profile on Hemming which referred to him as the staffer the White House pays  $89,000 a year to spot and distribute positive stories from the mainstream media. Hemming was senior adviser for research at the RNC in the 2016 cycle and director of research on the Trump campaign. At the White House, he worked from 5:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. every weekday and was a regular in reporters  inboxes, blasting out stories favorable to the administration.Hemming has not yet commented on his decision to leave the position, but White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that it was a  [m]utual decision that he could best help promote the president s agenda on the outside. Andy is smart and very talented and we wish him all the best. All administrations have people dedicated to finding and spreading news stories that show the president in a good light, but performing these duties with Trump at the helm was no doubt a unique experience. There surely isn t much positive media coverage on him these days because, in addition to being a raging bigot, he continually manages to screw up even the simplest of tasks (like not frying his retinas while watching the eclipse). How Hemming kept from completely losing his mind long before now is anybody s guess.Featured image via Chris Kleponis-Pool/Getty Images",News
" Trump Wants It Both Ways, But You Canâ€™t Pass The Most Bills If â€˜Theyâ€™ Wonâ€™t Let You Pass Bills","Everybody s gotten used to Donald Trump contradicting himself. You can almost count on it, really. But with the exception of a few notable misspellings and typos, generally, his tweets that contradict previous tweets don t come on the same day, let alone in the same hour. And a contradictory pair in the span of eleven minutes? Maybe he s reprising another guy s role.Friday morning, Trump did just that. He complains all the time, but the two complaints that he tweeted just after 6:30 his time just don t go together. First, he says that 8 Democrats  control  the Senate because of the filibuster. Trump has advocated that the GOP use the nuclear option to get rid of the filibuster for some time, but most if not all Republicans are hesitant   they know that if they do, the next time voters elect a Democratic majority, their opposition will be able to ram through any legislation they like, with nothing to stop them. That s something Trump doesn t understand neither party wants.If Senate Republicans don't get rid of the Filibuster Rule and go to a 51% majority, few bills will be passed. 8 Dems control the Senate!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2017Just eleven minutes later, Trump came to his senses and realized if he says the GOP can t pass bills   and he is the leader of the GOP   then he can t keep saying he s passed more bills than a concert promoter on a New York subway. So he went back to that.Few, if any, Administrations have done more in just 7 months than the Trump A. Bills passed, regulations killed, border, military, ISIS, SC!  Donald J.

Just leave out  if any  next time, so what could be admin doesn t look like ass.But complaining about the Democrats in Washington keeping him from doing what he wants is quickly becoming one of his favorite topics. There are the hilariously wrong-in-retrospect messages:Despite the long delays by the Democrats in finally approving Dr. Tom Price, the repeal and replacement of ObamaCare is moving fast!  Donald J.

You know, the best, most amazing, biggest by far in the history of the world tweets about how incredibly, ridiculously huge his successes are, which of course are the most successful of all time?Well, those are there, too, but I m not going to bore you by re-posting a bunch of tweets where Trump tries to Bannonize the old nine-iron. The point is, Trump really wants to have it both ways   that he simultaneously is the most bestest at presidenting, and that those dirty demon-dog Democrats won t let him president properly. He s not even close on the claim that no  A  has done more. He s behind Bill Clinton in bills passed and signed by about 30% for this point in his presidency.And that s just fine by me.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News
" REPORT: Mueller Hot On Trumpâ€™s Trail, Has Built His Own â€˜Miniature Justice Departmentâ€™","Donald Trump is very afraid of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. It has been reported repeatedly that he is completely obsessed with the Russia investigation, and it seems that he is right to be. According to a new report in the Daily Beast, Mueller has built what they are calling an  army  of lawyers to investigate just what went on with Russia s interference into the 2016 presidential election, and especially into any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government officials.The new report says that Mueller s team now includes 16 heavy-hitting attorneys, and they have space deep inside one of the most secret locations in Washington, and the space includes a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCHIF), which is the name for places no laymen and laywomen like us will ever see the inside of. The secrets kept in there are pretty much in a tomb, until those privy to them see fit to release them. On top of all of that, it seems that Mueller has pulled together what the Daily Beast is calling his own  Miniature Justice Department. The Daily Beast assembled a list of the names on Mueller s team, and their resumes are nothing short of stellar. Only one has never worked as a federal prosecutor, but he is a top notch lawyer in his own right and is surely useful. You can read the lengthy accomplishments of these attorneys here.In short   Trump is right to be scared out of his mind. It also bears noting that sometime ago now, Mueller actually convened his own grand jury   which means he has enough to believe he will stumble upon something that will warrant criminal indictments. Further, this team of lawyers has broad authority to subpoena anyone and everyone in Trump s orbit and force them to testify under oath. Also, remember   even if they aren t under oath, lying to government officials is still a crime, so these people better start learning to tell the truth unless they want to face some serious jail time.Come on, Special Counsel Mueller. We re rooting for you. With any luck, everyone in Trump s White House will be thrown out of office and in jail before the 2018 midterms.Featured image via Ann Heisenfelt/Getty Images ",News
 House Dem Wants GOP On Record: Stop Govâ€™t Spending At Trump Properties,"Early next month, the GOP-controlled House of Representatives will take up a spending bill that provides funding for nearly every department in the federal government. It s a must-pass bill because, without it, the government will shut down. That s a non-starter for many Republicans, who still feel the pain of the last time there was a government shutdown. Republicans were largely unable to shift blame to the Democrats as they attempted to do, and their popularity suffered as a result. But despite the GOP s absolute grip on Congress, the bill is still subject to amendments, and one Democrat from Tennessee has a doozy in mind.Representative Steve Cohen is introducing amendments to the spending plan that would ban the use of federal funds at Trump-branded properties. It covers every business listed on Trump s financial disclosure form, including hotels, country clubs, and resorts. That means events like the ones at Mar-a-Lago where Trump has hosted dignitaries and foreign leaders would either be held elsewhere, or Trump would have to provide accommodations free of charge.Such an arrangement would have prevented the Secret Service from having to stay in a trailer outside Trump Tower, where they moved after price negotiations fell apart over them staying inside while protecting the president. It also would have precluded the State Department from spending upwards of $15,000 on rooms at a hotel that Trump recently opened in Vancouver. Most of all, it might reduce the amount of money you and I pay for the president to spend more than 20% of his time in office (so far) at his own resorts.In a statement Cohen released Wednesday morning, he said:Congress should not allow the President to use his office to profit himself and his family.  The President s refusal to divest from his privately owned businesses creates a conflict of interest when steering federal spending to his resorts and other businesses  The American people should have total confidence that the President is serving their interest, not his own financial enrichment.  President Trump s refusal to disclose information to Congress or seek Congress s authorization for accepting profits from foreign governments stemming from his sprawling foreign financial interests is a brazen violation of the Constitution and a danger to our democracy.We couldn t agree more, Congressman. And while these amendments stand about a snowball s chance in hell of passing   or possibly even being brought up for a vote   it will be nice to see you force Republicans to go on record and either declare their allegiance to Donald Trump, or to the principles of conservatism.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News
