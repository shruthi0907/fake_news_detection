# fake_news_detection
This project is developed in the motive of helping us to detect the fake and true news.A fake news can be very misleading and create commotion within the general public . So this project has helped us to detect the fake news .

Tools used : Python 

Features:
 seted up a pipeline for a machine learning model that uses Random Forest Classifier to classify text data as either fake or real news.
 The pipeline first applies the TfidfVectorizer to transform the text data, followed by the Random Forest Classifier.
•	TfidfVectorizer: This step transforms the raw text data into a vectorized representation using the TF-IDF algorithm. It takes the raw text data as input and outputs a vectorized representation. 
•	RandomForestClassifier: This step trains a random forest classifier model using the vectorized text data. It takes the vectorized text data as input and outputs the trained model.

Working:
1)EDA - basic eda and profiling
2)Data pre-processing
3)Model building
